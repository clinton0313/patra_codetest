"After 6 years of faithful service, my hard drive died a few weeks ago. I bought another Gateway and it was recommended to me that I get Spy Sweeper.

I had never ran any Spy tool up until now, choosing just to use Anti-Virus Software. I had wondered if Spy Sweeper would be redundant.

Well, I have Spy Sweeper 5.0.7.1608 and within the first few days of having my new computer, this software caught 3 incidents of spyware that my Anti-Virus never detected!

This tool sweeps files, registry, cookies...everything. It will quarantine first, and then you can choose to delete it.

My system is FAST, and I've not seen Spy Sweeper act unusually in any way, nor has it taken up too much memory. (I have AMD Athlon, 64 X2 dual core processor 3800+ with 1.87 GB of RAM--running on XP.) I have all 12 recommended shields running at all times.

Spy Sweeper will sweep every week, but you can choose to sweep anytime. Sweeps, for me, have only taken 5-6 minutes.

My experience has been very positive with Spy Sweeper, especially when I saw it catch several spyware that my Anti-Virus *didn't* pick up. Very affordable software for the kind of protection it provides, in my opinion.",0
"So far so good - this is a comprehensive and powerful application for big business accounting - in addition to budget and payroll, there are excellent tools for tracking growth and profit.  I'm a small business owner, an artist, and I find it fantastic for tracking inventory and sales, but there are tools that will make it easy when I begin to expand my business too.  I'm just starting to scratch the surface as to what it can and can't do - so far, I can say that the software is user friendly, although there is a steep learning curve if you aren't an accountant!",0
This has been a great and easy software to use. I have used this program to keep my MS Windows PC safe and it has done a great job. I like that it is an easy program to use and is fast at scanning my computer. I also like that it does not take a lot of my system recourses to run. Also getting updates is really easy and so is renewing your subscription to the updates. I would recommend this version of Norton software for anyone who wants an easy full security software for their computer.,0
"This router is great. The setup and installation was very easy. I've tried other routers, but this is by far the best.",0
"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",0
"This ""Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010"" software package is a good basic starter kit for a PC or laptop.

"First time user of the product after a decade+ of using TurboTax. The TurboTax price increases finally got me to give this a try. TaxCut is different but functional... and it works. Got my refunds. Only complaint was at printouts. For some reason it thinks you've got legal sized paper and gives you no choice to print a copy otherwise. It prints out a page plus a remnant page for each actual document page. Also, the text at the bottom of the pages are cut-off. Best bet is to save as a .pdf and print outside the program.",0

"Having used Peter Nortons products since their inception, I have come to rely on his security software as part of my standard security set up.

The other software tools they have are also very handy if you have a need.

The multi packs are great, as I have a number of computers at home that I have to maintain.

getting the 1 user 3 PC is a inexpensive way of protecting my home network of masheens! its got what computers need!",0
"I ussally purchase anti-virus programs at the store so that I can get a ""cd"" incase I need to boot from it to fix viruses. Found that you can ""make a boot Disk"" from norton's site to boot your PC if needed to clean some of the viruses off that way. Have tested this version with Windows 7 Ult. 64 bit and found it does what is says. Stopped viruses for getting into the system and let's you know what it is and what happened. A must for web browsing today.",0
"I have been satisfied by turbotax for many years.  No complaints.  I use this for partnership return, it generates the k1 forms, and pdf files for records as well as e filing.  It does not include the state program, has to be bought separately.  only works on windows, not mac computers.",0
"I have been using SM for nearly 5 years now. I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

Highly recommended!",0
"Microsoft MapPoint 2010

While this may not be technically correct, MapPoint appears from a user standpoint to be an enhanced version of Microsoft's  Streets and Trips.  Both can be used for plotting trips, and with a GPS adapter, turn your laptop into a full blown GPS. Using a computer to plan trips has a lot of advantages over a standalone GPS.  You can plan your trips and side trips on a large screen, easily save and edit them, and look up possible destinations on the internet at the same time.  The bad news is you need your laptop in the car when you do go on a trip and that takes up a lot of room compared to the standalone GPS. One nice feature is that routes created in MapPoint can be downloaded to some standalone GPS unit (mainly Garmin, check the MapPoint website at Microsoft.com).
MapPoint adds features that I feel will mainly be used for business. It has the ability send maps and data to Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).  It can also pull data from Office applications and SQL databases and use that data to create maps. Developers can program their apps to use MapPoint to generate maps that are incorporated into their software or websites.

This is a great (and advanced) product if you need it's advanced features.  But if you are looking at this for home use planning trips, save some money and buy Streets and Trips (or a standalone GPS).",0

"I have used most of the other non-free antivirus programs and usually found something about them that disturbed me. I was using a free av application when a friend recommended avg (free version), I gave it a try and was impressed with the results. One of them main things I don't like in an av program is that some ""intrude"" on my computer and slow things down. AVG didn't do that. When I spotted AVG Internet Security 2011, I found several additional protection items that impressed me. I like the level of security it provides. The one user version that I have is limiting since I have two machines to protect. You might want to consider whether you need a security program that will protect more than one computer. I like AVG Internet Security 2011. I feel comfortable with it leaving any fears about my computer being compromised behind.",0
"I am an Army Reservist and had to learn Arabic really quickly.  I used Rosetta Stone and couldn't believe how fast I learned Arabic basics.  Well, I'm back from the Middle East and can tell you that what they teach you is applicable and correct.
So, I am planning a trip to Italy in a few months and immediately thought of Rosetta Stone because I only know as much Italian as what I have heard from watching the Saprano's.  I have been using the system for the last couple of month's now and I feel very confident in being able to carry on a basic conversation in Italian and I am only though 1/2 of the course.  I'm astonished.
For those not familiar with Rosetta Stone's programs, they are hand's down the easiest way to learn a language.  Just brief over the basic instructions, put the disc in your drive, and start--it's that simple!  You don't have to pour over manuals, dictionaries, audio discs/tapes or history books.
I've tried Berlitz and many other programs in the past that required all of those other 'tools' and their systems depended on memorization.  Other programs don't work for me.  Rosetta stone uses another approach by allowing you to learn a language in a way that allows you to UNDERSTAND the language instead of MEMORIZING a language. If I can't remember a shopping list, how can I memorize an entire language?

By the way, the US Army offers only 1 language program free to soldiers and it's Rosetta Stone...because it is the only one that works.",0

"First, let me say I love Corel products - menus are intuitive, easy to load, easy to use. Corel Ulead VideoStudio was no exception.

For under $100 (list price of $129, Amazon price is currently $59), please do not expect professional editing software. I found no problems whatsoever in my experiments, but I'm a complete novice in video editing, was not working with large files or Hi-Def.

Most importantly, please note that a newer version of this software (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X4/dp/B004PIPG2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio Pro X4</a>) is available for the same price or less (list price of $99, Amazon price is currently $59).

Nonetheless, I believe this version (11.5+) is still valid (works with Win XP/Vista/7). HOWEVER, Pro X4 has a LOT of new features I wish I could play with: stop motion tools, time-lapse effects, create/burn in Blue-Ray, add 3D (even includes glasses) ... so unless you find a deep discount on the old version, check out the new version first. (And, I hear rumors that a Pro X5 will be released soon).",0
"I've always been a fan of McAfee's Total Protection, so I was a bit skeptical about Webroot.

But, after installing it on my laptop, my fears have been alleviated.  The total install size was much smaller than what I'm used to, but all the functionality is there.  Better still, the default security settings on Webroot didn't make my machine unusable:  no overly restrictive firewall rules, no quarantining half of my programs, no blocking web access to my favorite games.

Installation was clean and simple.  The initial scan took a long time, but completed with no issues and no false alarms.positives as of yet, and no blocked apps.  I don't download freeware/shareware off of the internet, so I guess the woes of my fellow reviewers don't apply to me at all.

"I have use Quicken for over 15 years and I can't believe how cumbersome and poorly conceived this version is compared to past versions.  The main page is useless and you now have to open multiple windows to get the information you need, then you have to close all the windows you opened to get to the next account.  When looking at a performance page of your investment accounts you get a pie chart instead of a bar graph.  What good is a pie chart when you are looking at performance data over a specific time range.  I thought the purpose of newer versions was to improve the existing version and not regress.  If Microsoft still had a financial program I would be forced to migrate to another program.  Intuit needs to change it's company name because this program is not intuitive.  It is ill conceived and makes for a frustrating experience.",1
"I had been using Trend Micro TITANIUM 2011 internet security software for an entire year without a single problem.  No viruses got through, no problems that I'm aware of.  It's been the same so far with TITANIUM 2012.  I use an old computer running Windows XP.  It took about 10 -15 minutes to install including the re-boot.  What I like about this particular program over several others that I have used in past years is that this program runs silently in the background never ever bothering me to answer questions about what I would like done with a virus or problem it has detected.  It takes care of it by itself.  It updates silently, I can continue doing whatever it is I'm doing without being interrupted.  It does a periodic full scan and will let me know that it's doing that but I can minimize it and continue working. It's got the option of site restrictions for kids but I don't use that because it's more trouble than I like to go through.  My kids know the rules for using my computer anyway and there will be hell to pay if they break them. But others might find them useful.

Overall, this has been my favorite anti-virus software over the many other brands that I have used in the past.",0

"You, as Nancy Drew, embark on a journey to discover where Jake Hurley's lost mine is. On the train, who Lori Girard's (a very rich and, uh, doesn't have a lot upstairs girl) father owns, you are accompanied with John Grey, an actor on the TV show, Ghost Hunters; Tino Balducci, a ""#1"" cop who just happened to be in the right place at the right time when he nabbed those criminals; Charleena Purcell, who writes romance novels; and the legendary HARDY BOYS!!

  Throughout the course of the mystery, you solve many puzzles. Most are easy. Then, you wait until you get to your destination: Copper Gourge. This is where Jake Hurley, the man who originally owned the train now owned by Lori's father, buried his wife, Camille, who died on the train while the couple were heading to Jake's lost mine.

"Norton is THE BEST when it comes to internet security.  This particular product gives you 3 licenses, which you know you're eventually going to want another license if you buy computers often, so I definitely recommend going ahead and getting the 3 pack like this.  Norton has prevented several viruses from infecting my computer.  When I've tried competitors they've let things through.  I also love the Norton 360 for the password management system, which keeps track of all your passwords even across computers.  It really is a game-changing product.

"Kaspersky replaced McAfee on my computer, low resource utilization and no problems. Easy installation.

Not only can I use my computer at any time, I can also print on my wireless connected printer. McAfee decided that since I did not have their product installed on the ""computer"" on my home network I could not use it. To print I had to disable the firewall. Kaspersky correctly identifies the device as a printer and have no problems using all of the features of my all-in-one.

The installation was flawless and fast, even though there was a new version available and the download was large.

Full system scan runs very quietly on the background and I don't even notice it is doing anything, I had to open the window to see if it was still doing it or it was completed. It also ran in half the time of what McAfee used to take, and you do notice McAfee when it is running.

Another advantage is that it has not used up another license because I am running a multi-core processor, McAfee had me at five licenses because of this problem. My computer is set-up as a single user computer.

I have not contacted support for anything, so I can't rate it.

I have not found any of the problems reported in other reviews for 64-bit based systems with multi-core processor (Intel i7 X980) and Windows 7 ultimate, every program performs flawlesly and starts faster than they were starting before I switched to Kaspersky.",0

"Everything that I said two years ago when reviewing Pro X6 is still true in Pro X7.  The software does, in fact, load much faster when opened.  (I honestly have not timed it to say that it is 30%, but I will say that it is significant and noticeable).  Also, there is over 200MB worth of content that you can download for free on Corel that supplements the software with additional brushes, images, clip art, etc.  I still love this software and still stand by my opinion that this is a great alternative for the rest of us who dabble in image editing and cannot justify the price of Adobe's product.

Previous Review of Paintshop Pro X6
Let me start off by saying that I am not a professional publisher nor do I create magazine ads for a living.  I am a programmer who often has the need to creative professional looking graphics for internal webpages and the like.  And, like most folks, I really would like to use Photoshop, but I can never justify the cost of a license to myself (or my employer).  Why can't there be a quality product for the rest of us that doesn't cost and arm and a leg?  And the answer is Corel Paintshop.  When I first installed the software, I wasn't expecting much - but after using it on several occasions, I can say that it is intuitive, easy to work with, and produces the same type of effects and functionality that I would use in Photoshop at 1/6 of the price.  Oh, I am sure that Photoshop can do more than this, but for your average person, I think that Paintshop is perfect.  I have nothing bad to say about this software and think it is a great value compared to Adobe Phtoshop.",0

It was as easy as I hoped and, honestly, I'm beside myself; wow! Microsoft actually got something right.",0

"The Good:

*Sea of features you'd expect from Corel
*Supports art pens, tablets and other peripherals
*Great User Interface

The Bad:

*Intimidating for newbies

The Bottom Line:

A great program that you'd expect from Corel.  I wanted an upgrade for Windows Paint and boy was I wrong!  This program is way way waaaaay more than just a simple paint program.  It actually scared me off with when it listed terms like ""color theory.""  An instruction booklet contains over 90 pages and it actually offers customer support for those who are stuck.  This is an advanced program and using a program like this to draw a 3D cube would be like having Pavarotti to sing at an empty warehouse.  I took a challenge of learning it and actually produced some of my best digital artworks.  Therefore to simply put:  If you need a simple upgrade to Windows Paint, this may not be for you.  However, professionals out there will apprecaite this program greatly.",0

"I started using CorelDRAW on a Mac 512, back in the late '80s, as an improvement over MacDraw.  As the years went by, the reality is that most of the world is on PCs, not Macs.  I wasn't doing enough graphics work to justify a good package, so I made a lot of graphics with Visio, PowerPoint, or (eeeek!) ""Paint"".  Finally, I moved up to Adobe PhotoShop -- What a headache!!!  It took a week's worth of classes to learn how to use the daggone thing!

Remembering how much better CorelDRAW was on the old Macs, I was eager to try this -- and I am NOT disappointed!  I have been using the PhotoPaint part of this package a lot, and it is - relatively speaking - intuitive to learn and easy to use.  Now, no graphics beginner is going to say that -- it's still a complicated package, but for someone with a decent graphics background (though by no means an expert), it's straightforward.  I have used the help file to find things, but once I find them, they are intuitive to use - I need the help file, but not a textbook or a class to teach me what the help file means!

PhotoPaint is POWERFUL, yet fairly direct.  A HUGE improvement over Adobe PhotoShop.  I would definitely choose Corel over Adobe here.  The products are a significant investment, though, so I would weigh how much I'm doing graphics before spending to upgrade to Corel, if I already had PhotoShop.  However, for any new ""seats"", licenses, computers, etc., I would definitely go Corel.

I also used the CorelDRAW part of the package, and for how I use vector graphics, it may be a little better than Visio or PowerPoint, but not a big difference.  I might choose it over the others, but I wouldn't bother with the expense to upgrade to it.

"I switched from PC to Mac two years ago once Apple converted to Intel based processors.  One of the main factors in getting me to make the jump was a piece of software called Parallels, which allowed me to run my Windows applications at native speed alongside my Mac apps.  The techie term for this is ""virtualization,"" essentially a ""computer within a computer.""

Mac users are very fortunate to now have two outstanding commercial options for virtualization:  the venerable Parallels Desktop, and the upstart VMWare Fusion.  Although I have been a loyal Parallels customer since its initial release, I must concede that VMWare Fusion 2 currently has the edge.

VMWare as a company is, of course, far from being the rookie in the virtualization market.  On the PC side of the fence, VMWare has dominated  for years with a very mature virtualization engine that runs on a variety of platforms.  That experience is clearly reflected in their Fusion product.

VMWare Fusion 2 is mature, fast, and a vast improvement over Parallels Desktop.  Fusion feels more 'Mac-like,' offers easier printing options, and is noticeably faster on both my Mac Pro and Macbook Pro.  It works with existing Boot Camp partitions as well as a self contained 'virtual machine' that stores itself as a single file on your hard disk.  Virtual machines from Parallels Desktop can be converted to VMWare format.

While the bells and whistles are nice, two things for me sets VMWare Fusion apart from Parallels:

1.  Overhead.  While Parallels has almost a constant 20% idle rate drain on my CPU, VMWare is practically at zero when idle.  Memory usage is more efficient too.  This is significant, especially if you're running Windows programs alongside Mac apps on a notebook where memory and CPU are often at a premium.  When it does need some horsepower, VMWare supports multiple processor cores - something the current version of Parallels doesn't.

2.  Appliances.  VMWare has a very active ""appliance"" community that continually adds value to the product.  Appliances are pre-configured virtual machines that run everything from open-source servers to full Linux distributions.  They are a great way to experiment with some of the great open source software projects without having to go through the aggravation of installation and configuration.  Just download the appliance and boot it up with VMWare Fusion.  In fairness, Parallels does have its own appliance community, but it is nowhere near as robust as VMWare's community.

CONCLUSION

Mac users looking to run Windows and Linux have a great choice between two very capable virtualization apps.  The edge right now almost definitely goes to VMWare.  It not only sports a more intuitive interface, it also requires far less overhead and has an outstanding community behind it.

I have no doubt the upcoming release of Parallels Desktop 4.0 will bring both competitors back on equal footing.  But for now, VMWare Fusion 2 is the superior virtualization application for Mac users.",0
"Made in the USA, Vipre AntiVirus takes protecting your computer to a whole new level!  With VIPRE requiring minimal system resources (unlike: Trend Micro, Norton, Webroot, McAfee, and Kaspersky) which allows your valuable system resources to run your computer's programs faster!

  With unlimited home licensing, choosing VIPRE was a no brainer for me since I have over 5 computers in my house which need virus protection.

  In addition to unlimited home licensing, VIPRE carried their product one more step in allowing you to install their product on a netbook without the need of buying an external DVD reader (most net books do not have an internal CD/DVD drive, such as my MSI Wind).

Installing VIPRE on a NETBOOK:

  All you have to do is put your VIPRE installation disc into your computer's drive and copy the disc's content onto an empty thumb/flash drive. Once the files are successfully copied insert the flash drive into your net books usb drive and follow the onscreen installation instructions! It's that easy!

Secure File Eraser:

  The secure file eraser allows you to delete sensitive documents and files, without having to worry about someone scanning your computers deleted files and recovering your once thought deleted files! Yikes!

  I'm going to be selling a computer on EBAY in a few days and I'm anxious to try this new feature out! (P.S. Before selling any computer, it's always a good idea to reformat then run a secure file eraser like VIPRE.)

RECAP: If you're looking for new ANTI virus software, give VIPRE a look, it won't dissapoint....",0
"Photomatix Pro 6 is an excellent post photography program for HDR photos. The program has a bit of a learning curve but nothing beyond the capabilities of anyone somewhat experienced in Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. It's a stand-alone program and a Lightroom plug-in, too, for combining photos into HDR, with a huge array of available adjustments. And it's ability to transform the ordinary into the spectacular is nothing short of amazing.

The Pro 6 version of Photomatix is considerably different from earlier versions I have been familiar with and it compares very favorably against other HDR programs I have used, e.g. Photoshop CC, HDR Efex Pro, and Luminar, to name a few. And it can be acquired at a 15% discount, too, if you look around.",0
"A very good antivirus-antispyware.
I've used a lot of different antivirus programs in the past but will probably stick with this one in the future.
For one thing it's easy to install and works well. It also doesn't slow down your computer when the program is running and another plus is the fact that it can be used one more than one computer. Just make sure that you first delete any other antivirus programs that may already be on your computer, otherwise the programs may conflict.",0

"I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).",0

"I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 5 schedule K-1 from various LLC investments (including 2 oil drilling investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, more than 5 stock trading accounts...etc. First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return. Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R's Tax Cut. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R tax cut for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It also allow me to fetch specific form to allow manual modifications. I can also do quite some if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. Also, the cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (I have rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and Tax Cut are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend Tax Cut for its value.",0

If you are looking for editing software at a decent price, really consider this one.

"I'm the CTO of an IT company who uses a mac, but needs Windows.  So I've been using VMware and Parallels alternately for years.  I had most recently been on Parallels 7, and when I upgraded to the Parallels 8 Beta, I had no problems.  No issues.  The migration was fine, and after the upgrade, the VM ran beautifully.  I'm on an SSD so any benefits to the claims of faster booting isn't something I'd really notice, as my system was already booting in less than 15 seconds anyway.  The tools installed fine, dragging and dropping from my physical laptop's desktop to the VM's desktop and vice versa worked great.  Publishing the apps from windows into Mac worked without any hitches as well, but I only did that for testing as I don't run my VM's in that mode - I prefer the windowed mode to keep everything separated.
Only glitch I've hit is one that's been around forever that I've hit in both VMWare and Parallels, and that's the random hiccup with the networking, where it doesn't connect when you have it set to ""default adapter"" and you have to go to the VM tools and force it to use physically the card you're on.  With my previous Macbook Pro it was annoying as I had the gigabit onboard and the wireless, and I changed from one to the other depending on whose network I was on and whether there was wireless available.  But I'm on the new Retina MBP which doesn't have a built in Ethernet, so I can at least leave it set physically to my wireless and be working.  It's easy enough to remember when I pull out the thunderbolt gigabit adapter to change the settings if needed.
All in all, another rock solid product.  If it weren't for that little glitch sometimes with the adapter settings if you're trying to bridge the network, I'd be great.",0

"This is a great switch. I wish, so bad I had found this before I wasted money on my netgear switches. This is so feature rich, I spent quite some time learning how all the features work. You do need another kind of switch to fully use the vlans offered by this unit. I did figure out this trunking is not the cisco type of trunking. If you want the cisco type, it is called ""tagged"" in the vlan config. This trunking is more like link aggregation. This is a nice feature to have! On a final note, this model has been discontinued. The new HP hotness is the 1810G-8.

My only complaints are. This switch does not support STP, or spanning tree protocol. They have updated the firmware the pass the traffic to prevent a packet storm. Also the IP you use to manage this switch does not support IPv6. This should be really easy to add. I just want it to have a set IPv6 address.

Wonderful unit.",0
"Windows Vista truly is a step backwards.  After running it on three different high-end systems, and switching back to Windows XP on two of them and Ubuntu linux on the third, I can confirm what everyone else is saying: Stay with Windows XP as long as possible.

And I'm an MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer), so I should be towing the company line, but simply cannot:

Here are the primary issues I experienced:

- Lack of stability - Vista running Media Center remains operational for a few days, then slows down to a crawl.  Rebooting may or may not solve the problem.  Windows Defender also crashes at startup, and the computer will periodically blue screen.  No rollbacks, driver updates, BIOS updates or anything else help.
- Speed - Vista is significantly slower than Windows XP at everything - games, Internet connectivity, file operations, everything.
- Drivers - Per IDG, there are simply no Vista drivers for 72% of peripherals released in the last year, and only 4% of peripherals released within the last three years has a Vista driver.
- Security - Windows XP with a good security suite like Trend Micro or Kaspersky is easily as secure as Vista, without the constant popup messages about program actions.  And do you really want Microsoft providing security software to cover the holes that they have left in the operating system software that they are providing?!?
- Cost - It is becoming increasingly clear that other options, like Macintosh, are starting to provide the flexibility to over come the usual complaints about them - they can now run Windows XP natively alongside MacOS, and get all of your productivity intact.  It's best to seriously consider going over to Mac land and seeing what they have to offer you!
- Lastly, DRM. Microsoft has written draconian DRM into every part of the operating system.  No more ripping DVDs for you!  No more trying yo copy
the music you bought and have it automatically loaded and converted to MP3!  NOOOO...Now you only have protected WMA tracks, which only YOU can listen to.  Or even better - try to play an HDDVD or BLURay on your system, experience the joys of downleveling.  Behind the scenes, Microsoft will intentionally degrade your video quality, unless you spend much more to buy ""secure"" versions of your motherboard, DVD-Drive, Monitor, and cabling that make piracy harder, and your life much harder.

Stick with XP as long as you can, and investigate the alternatives like LinuxMCE and MacOS; Microsoft has seriously dropped the ball, and service pack 1 is not going to address the issues.  It's time to look at other options for operating systems.",1
"Better than average, quite well as a matter of fact.  Still running after 2 years.  Good range also.  XP users be advised to have at least Service Pack 2 (or 3 is recomended) installed to identify stations properly that use more than WEP encryption.",0

"First, let me say I love Corel products - menus are intuitive, easy to load, easy to use. Corel Ulead VideoStudio was no exception.

"I've been using the Quicken WillMaker Plus software since 2011. It has changed very little since that time, but each year (as with most popular software) it is updated and a new version is put on the market. Older versions came with a book from Nolo explaining various legal terms and information about living trusts. The current 2016 version offers online access to the living trust software for free for 1 year, but that implies a subscription thereafter, however the cost of that access is unclear.

I purchased this, the newest version, more as a curiosity than a need. Having used both the 2011 and 2013 versions - neither is supported by Nolo anymore thus current legal changes (which may or may not be the case for your state) don't show up on the forms in the software. There's no way to tell if your state will have any changes to specific forms for years to come, thus using older versions of this software is probably OK - but there's no real way to know.

This software can be installed via CD or by going to a download site (with the code in the box) and installing it following the download to your computer. Easy to do, and it automatically updates the software upon installation.

NOTE:  If you need to re-install the program, you can again download it and re-input your activation code or use the CD.  See photo for what comes in the box.

-----------------------------------------

RE: OLDER VERSIONS

If you are considering saving money by purchasing and older version of this software, just be aware your state may have some forms that have been updated and those updates won't be visible to you if updates are not supported.

I currently use the 2013 version - updated from the 2011 version - and noticed no real difference in the two for my state. No updates to the forms took place in those two years. I could add both programs to multiple computers without an issue (Windows 7 and 8 PCs) and it could be used by multiple users. The information inputted into one program was imported by the updated version and thus I only had to put in the info one time.

One thing that will happen with older versions though is that when you go to do the 'Web Update' in the software, you will receive a message stating that that version is no longer supported by WillMaker.

When I receive that message I click out of it and an update starts, but the update is only for the year of the software. For example in the 2013 version, the only updates the software received was for the year 2013. Legal changes to forms for other years did not show up.

Frankly, it's just a ploy to keep you buying the updated software - and the combination of the update and an Amazon Lightning Deal got me again. (Twenty-seven bucks was a small price to pay for this one.) **Not showing up as a 'verified purchase', despite having been purchased on Amazon. *

----------------------------------------

WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS SOFTWARE

Overall this is a great DIY-kit for those who don't have the money to pay attorneys for these services, but truly it's much more than that because it includes so many useful forms and can be used by several people. The interview format makes filling out the forms easy to do, and there's room to customize if desired. The resulting documents are legally binding, but in most cases do need signatures with witnesses to make it so.

If you have elderly parents, if you have children, if you have assets you want specifically dealt with in a certain way... this software is a cheap investment in protecting them all.

If you already have a Living Trust or a Will, and don't need all the forms (listed below), you can skip getting it, but I suspect if you're reading this review - you're not one of those people. Truly, it's worth the money and peace of mind.

-----------------------------------

ABOUT THE CURRENT VERSION:

The 2016 version states it will work with Windows Vista, 7 and 8. I'd like to assume it would work with 10 too, but the Amazon description doesn't indicate that so I went to Nolo's website and found this info.

"TurboTax 2011 has the same easy interface as prior years. The navigation seems a bit easier this year than the past years. I used to print out the TurboTax forms to mail them in. Now, I just used e-File. The federal and state returns are both free for the TurboTax Deluxe version! 2 hours with various tax documents and my TurboTax and I am done!

"I purchased the upgrade directly from Corel last year for just a little over $100.  I upgraded to Painter 2016 from Painter X3 because I liked the newer Particle and other Special FX brushes.  When I found out that I could download and utilize most of the Photoshop ABR brushes available online, that convinced me to take the plunge.  I'm glad Corel added this to Painter 2016, because I've been adding many different types of Special FX brushes since I purchased it.  I've lost cost of how many brushes I've downloaded, but let's just say that I'll never have to purchase any of the brushes Corel sells because I've found many variations on them and so much more.  Plus, I'll never have to worry about creating any ""custom"" brushes because I now actually have more than I'll realistically ever use AND THEN SOME!!!!  I've played around with many of them and have started utilizing some of them in a few recent illustrations.  Now, I can add many of the special effects that would've been either too time-consuming and labor-intensive to do from scratch.  Just like with Photoshop's Lens Flare, I have to constantly remind myself  that any effects I choose should serve the illustration, not overwhelm it (just for the record, I've found many ABR brush variations on the aforementioned Lens Flare, too).

The only negative is that Painter 2016 is slow to load when I initially click on it, no matter which of my laptops I use. After the first time, it boots up fairly quickly.

"After several years of using other security programs, I tried Norton 360 for 3 PCs.  It was far better than any others I have used before. Now my wife and I have tablets as well, so the 360 for 5 devices was perfect.  It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices (iOS devices get partial protection).

Installation was almost automatic. The license lets you install the software from their website with just one key. You can then manage all protected devices from your online account and move protections around as your collection of devices changes.

Norton 360 offers a password management feature, which is really handy. This feature stores usernames, passwords and credit card numbers and then fills in the information when opening your password-secured websites. That is very convenient if you have several online accounts.

Additional PC features include tune-up, backup and restore utilities. Norton includes a proprietary two-way PC firewall. Windows already comes with a firewall, but some people like the idea of having their firewall and anti-malware software come from a single source. The PC Tuneup cleans up Windows temporary files, Internet Explorer temporary files, Internet Explorer history cleanup, startup manager, registry cleanup and disk optimization.

The PC portion includes parental controls management. You can block access to sites that you don't want kids to visit and you can track where they go on the internet.

 The Safe Search Toolbar installs automatically so you can search safely right from your browser. There are plenty of search toolbars available.  I like having one that matches my PC security package.

Bottom line: Easy to install and covers just about everything I need.  What more could I ask for?",0

This is a very good video editing package. In the past I've only used Corel video editing products but Cyberlink's offering is on par. It offers similar options but they are different enough for me to want to use both products depending on what I'm trying to achieve. There are quick uploading options that make it very easy to get video onto Youtube and other online video sites.,0

"Hello, Says it can make my laptop run faster. I tried it and it did. It claims it is easy to use. Yes, it is easy to use. It claims it won't make a mess of my laptop. Right again. I used the easy button and believe the claims the developer made are accurate. UPDATE I installed this on my 64bit OS and soon received a message from the developer informing me that I need to discontinue Win cleaner on the 64bit OS. Due to reports of inflicting damage to the OS. I've been attributing the 64bit OS problems to MS updater loading the AMD 64 drivers on to my desktop w/Intel processor. Side Note...MS is really getting to be pain in my butt! UPDATE Wincleaner is a type of software that gets well...stolen. My KAV burned me and I in the end nuke the drive. I asked the software developer if I could have another shot at loading the software because unlike modern software that has the ability to recognize that it is back on the same computer (FAIR USE CLAWS) this software will not recognize the fact the it's reinstalled on the same computer. I call that stealing back the product.",0

"I have been a Corel VideoStudio user for quite a while, and this latest entry into the ring does not bring a massive set of differences other than that I have noticed it runs much better in Windows 8 and, after the free upgrade, Windows 10. The list of features is long enough that you will HAVE to take some time to read manuals (available only as a PDF) and view some rather good YouTube tutorials.
There are enough features that the enthusiast will not be too overwhelmed, and the templates help a lot. Tweaking the feature set to get a particular effect is possible to your heart's content, but let's not go overboard here: this is meant to be occupy a position between the very basic software and the more advanced, like Sony's Movie Studio Platinum (I think this was named Vegas). To get good, you will need to do some work, and the price point and feature list of VideoStudio Pro 8 is just right for that.

"This is our first LeapFrog Ultra eBook, and it has been a favorite of both boys.  Both boys love reading books as a family, and love to look through picture books on their own.

LeapFrog has provided a kids eBook that has 3 different reading levels/functions:  Read To Me - reads the story to your child, allowing the child to follow along.  Read With Me - Pauses along the story so kids can interact with the learning tools as they go.  Read On My Own - kids can read on their own.  They can even record their own voice and play it back instead of the narrator.

I recommend sitting down with your child to discover what can be done and how to explore with this eBook prior to letting them explore on their own.  Kids are great at discovering things on their own, but will get more out of it if they fully understand what they can do with the eBook.

I've got a 3 year old and a 6 year old, and the younger prefers the Read to Me, while the older prefers the Read With Me as he is learning to read in Kindergarten.

LOVE this new eBook offering from LeapFrog!",0
"We have several computers in my house, and I was looking for an economical option. Considering the fact that I probably go through a primary PC for work about once every two years, the price point of the Key Card was very attractive to me.

Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications.

"McAfee Total Protection with Site Advisor Plus provides a lot of value to home PC users. At an affordable cost, you can protect and manage up to 3 PCs with an impressive array of preventative maintenance and network administration tools. Importantly, you gain the peace of mind knowing that the software you are using is from McAfee, who for years has been recognized as a leader in security software solutions for business.

There are 12 main components to the product. These include software to help stop viruses, hackers, spyware and junk email. System administration tools include maintenance, file backup and restoration as well as tools for network configuration, file sharing and printing. Using an Internet connection, the software is continuously refreshed with updates so that you are protected from the latest threats.

I especially like the Site Advisor Plus feature which allows you to add a button to your browser's toolbar. When visiting a website, you can easily obtain a detailed status report of the site. The report includes an analysis of download tests for adware, spyware and other potential troublesome software; the number of emails you might expect to receive per month if you opt-in to a mail list; annoyances such as excessive use of popups; a schematic displaying the online affiliations of the site; and reviewer comments about the site. This nifty tool is immensely valuable when visiting a website for the first time and deciding how you might want to interact with the site, if at all.

The installation process was easy using a PC running MS Vista. I have since used McAfee to automate the process of backing up files to an external drive; the security updates are downloading automatically; and I frequently tuen to the Site Advisor tool for insight. In my opinion, the availability of these essential services in an easy-to-use package can save any home computer user the time and hassle of system maintenance, and consequently improve the home PC ownership experience.

I highly recommend this essential product to everyone.",0
"Let's face it: a lot of computer-assisted instruction is just plain lame or worse.

They can suffer from either being rote memorization schemes or over-glorified games or simply textbooks in electronic form.

Rare is a system that truly utilizes what computers can do best to solidly teach concepts.

Rosetta Stone delivers.

It teaches language using multiple sensory inputs (picture & voice) and multiple feedback mechanisms (your voice and hand-eye choices).  It is able to adjust and compensate for your learning speed and strengths on the fly.  It is engaging without being just a game.  And it is able to effectively teach without English--- which is the closest you can get to a dedicated immersion course.

I had previously installed and used the Spanish Rosetta Stone, and found that it was easy to install the Italian Rosetta Stone as a 2nd language onto my base installation on my computer.  My ten year old now is going around saying Italian phrases and saying, ""I can speak Italian!""

Bottom line:  I am very impressed.  My ten year old loves it, actually WANTS to do the lessons.  I'm having fun with it too, even though languages are definitely not my strong suit.  If you want to learn a language on your own, this is the best way I know to do it.",0

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Ergonomics & Usability:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 versions of both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro were resolved in this X4 version. It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 PaintShop Pro X4 offers a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 PaintShop Pro X4 combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 PaintShop Pro X4 has a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 PaintShop Pro X4 includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful, for both photo and video editing; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $90.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The PaintShop Pro X4 user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.
 VideoStudio Pro's ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode lets you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.
 VideoStudio Pro has a new time-lapse photography feature to create time-lapse movies from a set of photos shot over a period of time.
 The included proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro X4 works wonderfully to stabilize and remove the shake from hand-held videos.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PaintShop Pro X4 is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 PaintShop Pro X4 has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of the new PaintShop Pro X4 user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the PaintShop Pro software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation for both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.

This affordably-priced bundle essentially consists of two separate Corel products: PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4. In addition, the ""Ultimate"" extras that separate it from their non-Ultimate counterparts include: Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, extra ""Picture Tube"" images for use in PaintShop Pro, proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro, Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects, and coupons for WinZip software, Blurb.com photo book, and 21 free image downloads from Fotolia's Web site. If you are really only interested in either PaintShop Pro X4 or VideoStudio Pro X4, but do not want both products, you can just purchase either product in their separate ""Ultimate"" packaging.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.

Even though my video-editing skills rank far behind my photo-editing and graphics design skills, I started using Corel's VideoStudio Pro software when it was at version ""X2"". The VideoStudio Pro X4 version that is included in this software bundle offers powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. But as with the PaintShop Pro photo software, you need plenty of patience to progressively learn all of its features.

The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle's notable product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10. PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.

 This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.

 To help you navigate through the plethora of PaintShop Pro tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.

 PaintShop Pro includes tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.

 The new PaintShop Pro HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating. Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.

Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new PaintShop Pro ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo. This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well. As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.

 The new PaintShop Pro ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas. This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 A new PaintShop Pro ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo. These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 PaintShop Pro has built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email. Likewise, VideoStudio Pro lets you upload movies to YouTube.

 I had fun using VideoStudio Pro's new time-lapse photography feature. I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio Pro X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie. If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

 VideoStudio Pro lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy. The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders. There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks. You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects. Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips. Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips. Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous. This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

 As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment. The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources. You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip. You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks. The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks. While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

 After you have finished editing your video masterpiece in VideoStudio Pro, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime. You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube. The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices. This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities. Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use. This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos. Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie. 3D glasses are included with the software.

 The ""Ultimate"" version of VideoStudio Pro X4 includes proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software that really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The PaintShop Pro user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 I like the changes and improvements that Corel has made to VideoStudio Pro X4. I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively. But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio Pro X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser. With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application. Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

 VideoStudio Pro is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power. But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features. Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease. The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way. This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

 Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 PaintShop Pro X4 now requires only 1GB of disk space. The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 With this VideoStudio Pro X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.

 One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio Pro is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl. These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors. So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio Pro X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

 Back when I was using VideoStudio Pro X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video. Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this VideoStudio Pro X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4. When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio Pro X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old. As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $90.  For less than $100, there is currently no other commercial software that even comes close to the photo and video editing power and features that are offered in this fully-loaded bundle.

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility. But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4. And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

While the VideoStudio Pro X4 included in this bundle lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. And VideoStudio Pro X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity. If this video-editing software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 star",0
"After my mother clicked on something she shouldn't have and unleashed the bugs, I had her run Malwarebytes (free) on her PC. She couldn't do anything with her computer without a pop-up coming up for something she didn't want or her mouse intermittently becoming unresponsive prior to running that scan and cleaning out the malware files. That free program picked up 645 issues, but I felt like she needed something more so I bought this Premium version.

This version works quietly in the background and can be installed on up to 3 PCs with a 1 year subscription. Setting the schedule to automatically update the program is something that is done when the product is installed.

I suggest going into Settings, then Automated Scheduling to Edit the automatically set times. For me those were set to times when I've powered down my PC. I would also suggest adjusting for two scans a day (6 hours apart) versus one a day. The scans don't tax the PC's resources so they should run quietly int he background.

I like that this program adds an effective layer of protection to my PC. It's user-friendly and works as expected. Along with an antivirus program, it offers great security and peace of mind. Highly recommend it!",0

"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",0
"So far so good, I've been running SecureAnywhere AntiVirus 3 for a little over a month now. When I first installed it, it actually picked up on something my previous, expired antivirus (Avira) missed. No slow down or performance issues.

I doubt it blocks the NSA but other than that, for the price, this software does what I expect it to do without getting in the way.",0

"I started using CorelDRAW on a Mac 512, back in the late '80s, as an improvement over MacDraw.  As the years went by, the reality is that most of the world is on PCs, not Macs.  I wasn't doing enough graphics work to justify a good package, so I made a lot of graphics with Visio, PowerPoint, or (eeeek!) ""Paint"".  Finally, I moved up to Adobe PhotoShop -- What a headache!!!  It took a week's worth of classes to learn how to use the daggone thing!

Remembering how much better CorelDRAW was on the old Macs, I was eager to try this -- and I am NOT disappointed!  I have been using the PhotoPaint part of this package a lot, and it is - relatively speaking - intuitive to learn and easy to use.  Now, no graphics beginner is going to say that -- it's still a complicated package, but for someone with a decent graphics background (though by no means an expert), it's straightforward.  I have used the help file to find things, but once I find them, they are intuitive to use - I need the help file, but not a textbook or a class to teach me what the help file means!

PhotoPaint is POWERFUL, yet fairly direct.  A HUGE improvement over Adobe PhotoShop.  I would definitely choose Corel over Adobe here.  The products are a significant investment, though, so I would weigh how much I'm doing graphics before spending to upgrade to Corel, if I already had PhotoShop.  However, for any new ""seats"", licenses, computers, etc., I would definitely go Corel.

I also used the CorelDRAW part of the package, and for how I use vector graphics, it may be a little better than Visio or PowerPoint, but not a big difference.  I might choose it over the others, but I wouldn't bother with the expense to upgrade to it.

Note:  The Suite also includes ""Trace"" and ""Capture"", but I haven't used these, so I can't review them.",1

"I took the leap and installed Windows 8 Pro. I didn't do a clean install due the complex system I have and the number of programs and hardware that would have to be re-installed.

The anti-virus is now part of the OS. I did the whole install within Windows 7. Upon completion Metro appeared, when I flipped to my desktop it was as the same original 7. Wallpaper, folders and programs were all there. MS Office, Chrome and Firefox. IE10 is remarkably fast. Plus works great with a mouse.

"This version of Family Tree Maker comes with a free, six-month membership to Ancestry.com, which is just about the right amount of time for the casual user to research and create a full family tree. Although you could do the research manually, Ancestry.com consolidates a tremendous amount of information from divers historical documents and makes it relatively easy and efficient to discover information about relatives from long ago.

Family Tree Maker Deluxe allows the user to create (and back-up) genealogy offline before submitting it online, so it's my preferred method. You can work with your tree online, but by using the program on my home computer, then syncing when done, I avoid Internet glitches or user errors that cause lost data. So far, I haven't encountered any problems with this software, or with synching.

With this version for Mac, you can capture photos with iSight and import them directly into your Ancestry.com tree. If you don't own a scanner, this may be the best way to add pictures or copies of documents. Just make sure there is plenty of light for a clear picture.

Also included are the six reference training books on CD (see product description). I found them all useful; be sure to at least skim through them.

Family Tree Maker has been a good program for genealogy for years. I used it many years ago when it was just starting out and before it became PC-only. If you own a Mac, then I think you'll appreciate that there is now a version for us. The features built in to this program make it much better than the first version I used, and I liked that one. Since it also comes with research training books (on CD) and a free six-month membership to Ancestry.com it becomes a great package at a decent price.",0

She has enjoyed playing with animation software in the past, but up until Anime Studio Pro 8, she was never able to have her drawings traced and animated.  This software will do it, but it takes a lot of time to figure out 'how'.

This would be the negative to this software for the novice to intermediate user.  A tough learning curve that requires weeks, if not months of learning before you feel comfortable using it.  Some would argue that this is the case with most high-end software whether it relates to animation or not.  I would tend to agree, but it can be a con for some.

The positives to this software are many.  It can be used by PC or MAC users, offers the ability to bring your drawings to life, automatically lip-syncs your audio to the drawings, and allows you to import Photoshop files.

The Character Wizard is perhaps the easiest way to get started using the Anime Studio Pro 8 software, as you'll see results quickly and with the least amount of frustration.  Experts won't care about it, but if you're buying this to have fun with your computer and/or kids, start with with wizard!

The software is feature-rich with tweaks to color schemes, brush sizes, and layers (similar to Photoshop) which was expected.  What wasn't expected was the ability to do 3D renderings to share on YouTube.  Pretty cool stuff!  The ability to upload your creations to Facebook and YouTube is a fun perk.

Advanced users will love the ability to script their own tools and add-ons for the program, but frankly, this user will never get to that point!

All the major video formats are supported, with output up to 1080p and even in 3D.

Made for professional digital artists and animation professionals, Anime Studio 8 is loaded with amazing features and delivers what it promises on that front.

If you do not fall into that category of user, you may find it overwhelmingly hard to learn anything but the basics through the wizard.  You can learn more than that on your own, but it takes time in the form of a lot of reading and hands-on trial and error.  If you're brave enough to give it a try, and can commit to learning it, you'll be rewarded.",0

"Thanks Symantec...you've officially change my attitude (for the better) about running security software!

I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.

Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.

So, after roughly another year of ""living on the edge"", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).

Here's what I noticed:
+ Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute.
+ Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick.
+ Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.

About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.

So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!",0

"We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again.",0
"Fusion 5 is without a doubt a nice upgrade for existing Fusion users, especially if you're running OS X Mountain Lion, using a Retina Mac, or planning to use Windows 8 as a VM. And at $49.99, the price is hard to beat. At that price, and with its outstanding graphics performance, Fusion 5 is very tempting even if you already use other virtualization apps, such as Parallels or VirtualBox, which is free.

Fusion 5 has a few bumps, such as limited support for USB 3 and limited control over graphics options. For example, you can enable support for 3D accelerated graphics, but you can't assign memory directly to the graphics system. But the hits run circles around the few misses.  If you need a virtualization app for your Mac, VMware Fusion 5 not only deserves a look, BUY it and don't look back.",0
"I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 5 schedule K-1 from various LLC investments (including 2 oil drilling investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, more than 5 stock trading accounts...etc. First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return. Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R's Tax Cut. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R tax cut for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It also allow me to fetch specific form to allow manual modifications. I can also do quite some if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. Also, the cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (I have rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and Tax Cut are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend Tax Cut for its value.",0
Easy to install.  Worked as expected.  No problems.  Maybe a little slow.,0

"I've used Cyberlink products before, and this version of PowerDirector did not disappoint. I am, at best, an amateur videographer, and was able to use this software to edit and create some pretty sophisticated videos (especially given my level of expertise). I have not had the opportunity to use many of the more advanced editing features, but, I do appreciate that they are there if I need them. I think what is great about this product is:

a) It's simple enough for a beginner to use, and really makes the whole movie making experience enjoyable, even for a newbie (versus complex and frustrating)
b) It has many advanced features to satisfy those with more experience and more complex needs
c) The price is definitely reasonable for what the software provides
d) I trust Cyberlink and appreciate their level of customer service

All in all, I got what I expected from the software, and am pleased that there is much more to explore when time permits.",0
"Power Director Ultimate does a wonderful job helping you edit your videos.  By going to Directorzone.com, you can also view training videos to help you get started if you are new to using the software.  Plus, there are thousands of other users who post free templates and provide up-to-date advice to help almost anyone improve.  This online community is very helpful for beginners and advanced users.

As with any software, there is a learning curve but you have access to a lot of free training.  With PD13 Ultimate, they have also included a year of free 10GB storage in the cloud (you will have to pay after the year) to at least give you somewhere to put your videos temporarily.  PD13 Ultimate does not include AudioDirector 5 or ColorDirector 3 (you can get both of these with the Ultimate Suite).

With all of the included templates and quality effects (over 500) your creativity will be stimulated.  If you take the time to work with the program, you will find it fast and powerful.  Highly recommended!",0
"My computer recently crashed due to a lightning strike so I've been rebuilding.  I thought it would be a great time to upgrade my quicken as I went to Windows 7 on my machines.

I was dreading having to order the package and wait the couple of days to get it in the mail because my significant other wanted this little project done in one day.  I was very happy to find that this product was available for download and at a very competitive price.

THE DOWNLOAD:

I purchased this and then got an e-mail to download it right away.  It was installed in 15 minutes.  It's only about 60MB download and it came down really fast over broadband. If you're on dialup, Amazon has a little application that you download that can help you do downloads overnight and if you drop your connection, you can pick up where you left off.  Still, if you use dialup, you might just want to order the software.

Overall, I was happy with the download

PRODUCT:
If you're a quicken user, this is just quicken.  They did a facelift to it so that it looks somewhat like Office 2007, bigger buttons at the top.

I'll tell you what I liked right off the bat:
a) I was using Quicken 2005 and integration with my Bank was very very seamless with Quicken 2010
b) Since I lost my data from the lighting strike, I wasn't able to test recovery or upgrading files (I'm sure that's standard)
c) I liked that the default is a transaction is in one line (in 2005 transactions by default took too lines)

Overall, it's Quicken - it keeps track of my books and integrates nicely with my bank.  I like it.  I can't say I love it because I don't love balancing my checkbook and no matter what software was out there, it would still be a chore to do this job that needs to get done.  I have to say, Quicken makes it about as easy as you possibly can.

Get it, use it, it runs on Vista and Windows 7.  It's stable and reliable.  Don't get hit by lighting like my pc or all bets are off.",0
"I purchased Pinnacle Studio 18 Ultimate and had nothing but problems of it locking up and could not get anything done. I returned it (Thanks Amazon) and bought Power Director 13 Ultimate.

"I have used just about every version of Windows. These are my observations.

1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.

2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that ""just works"" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.

3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.

4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.

Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and ""just works"". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.",0
I was first introduced to 360 as a beta tester and enjoyed testing the product. I like the ease of installation. I like Norton products and have used them for years.

-affordable video and audio editing software that's fairly easy to use
-comprehensive detailed tutorials - definitely worth spending the time going through these if you're new to Sony

-gives you all the necessary tools to create great videos without overwhelming you with unnecessary features

Cons: really none in my mind! I don't think there's anything in this price range that is comparable and unless you're a pro looking for all the bells and whistles, this software provides all the capabilities/features you'll need.",0
"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on ""Download Software"" on the top banner, and select ""State Editions"".  Currently it says ""Available in January 2014"".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled ""Buy"" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy"" will turn into ""update"" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"I'm new to Apple/Mac, I finally bought a MacBook Pro after years of flirting with the idea.
I also grabbed a copy of Parallels 8 from the Apple Store and installed Windows 8. I'm not a big fan of Windows 8 but I need it for work.
I'm seriously impressed by this virtualization. I've done virtualization in the past (virtual linux and such) but let me tell you this is something else, especially in Coherence mode.
If I had known Mac + Parallels + Windows could work like this, I would have made the switch years ago.",0

"I only had 1 joint return to do, so Turbo Tax did what I needed it to do. I'm glad that early purchasers of this product spoke up (loudly) about the issue of paying to print out copies and to do more than 1 return. Luckily, the company listened to the outraged customers and fixed it. A rare occurrence in this day and age. As I mentioned, I only needed to do 1 Federal return so all was well for me. The product seems to get better and easier to use each year. I am able to e-file and do my state return (Indiana) for free through the state of Indiana's Government website so all I needed was this program with the free Federal e-file. Check with you own state to see if your state offers something like that before purchasing this program",0

"I've been using Norton anti-virus and backup products for years.  While they had their installation and usage problems early on, they have gotten better year by year.  This year's edition installs flawlessly on Vista, Win7 and Win8 computers.

Not only that, but Amazon's download prices are the best, far cheaper than purchasing the product directly from Symantec.",0
"I have always been a fan of Kaspersky software because it doesn't take over your computer and slow it down as much as Norton or others.

With this release, however, that is questionable. I have noticed a tremendous slowdown of my computer after installation. The software has always been very basic, very barebones, but one that does the job right. That hasn't changed it seems. I like that it costs less than $1 a month per computer.",0
"I occasionally do video projects, so I was excited to see the new version of Corel Studio. I find it to be exceptionally powerful, with lots of effects and good performance in editing and rendering.

The program came on two DVDs: one for the program (32 or 64 bit) and one for the extra add-on programs. Installation was painless, except that there was no integrated install screen; the two disks are stand-alone, and one might think at first that the second disk is for 32 bit or something. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have better labels than ""Disk 1"" and ""Disk 2"". Several of the add on programs tried to install the .net framework (which is already installed in Windows 8), but functioned fine. My system is an AMD Phenom 6 at 3.4 Ghz, with a 250Mb SSD that I used for the program, and a 2 TB data disk. I have 16 Gb of memory.

For new folks, there is a program called FastFlick, which opens up a set of templates that can be used to rapidly create a video. From what I can tell it is best suited to making picture slide shows, although various elements can be edited, and custom music can be used. But it pales in comparison to the capabilities of the main program.

For experienced users, or those wanting to be, the program offers seemingly endless possibilities for creating a sophisticated video. There are many options for transitions, editing, titles, music, mixing, and, well, just about anything. The program works by importing media files into the main program, then dragging the files onto a timeline. After that one can use additional tracks to add titles, music, additional video overlays, FX transitions, and many other options. A small preview area offers basic editing and clipping, plus full screen or partial screen preview. After the video is completed, there are options to ""share"" it, which means save in various formats: Computer (AVI, MPEG, H.264, MPEG-2, or WMV), phone optimized, Web optimized (HTML-5 projects are possible), DVD (including menus), or 3D. The program features full multi-processor support and 4K (I don't have any 4K video to test it with, however). The interface is advertised as more streamlined, and I did indeed find that it seemed to work better (particularly the add-in programs). Also included is a stand-alone handy screen capture/recording program, which would be good for creating presentations showing how a computer program is run. There are a number of templates, which are basically the components of the FastFlick program, but broken apart for individual use in the main program; these would provide a new user with some place to start. For those so inclined, the program integrates with a camera to perform stop-motion.

Performance wise, I rendered a 4 minute video in 9 minutes, which is a bit better than previous versions of the program.

Documentation is strictly online via a PDF file that can be either viewed or downloaded. The add-ons bring up a help file when needed; I found the manual and add-in files to be well written and useful. When the program opens up, one is offered the opportunity to view some tutorials on the ""discovery center"", which requires registration. There are additional templates and such available on line once registration is complete.

There are a number of add-ons bundled with the program. They are pretty easy to use; simply drag them to the clip, and then open the options and customize the effect - thus they are plug-ins and not stand-alone. They are found in the FX portion of the program. Titles include:

Boris Graffiti 6 - Animated titles
Newblue Colorfast - color correction
ProDad Mercalli SE - video stabilization (worked very well)
ProDad Vitascene V2 LE - this has a series of special effect screens
proDAD RotoPen - Produces a nice pen effect across the screen.
proDAD Handscript Animation - allows some custom movement of the screen
NewBlue Motion effect - Smear, liquify, etc. effects

Summary: A powerful program that needs some time to learn, but allows the user to put out basic projects fairly quickly, or complex projects with a bit more work. Highly Recommended.",0
"This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase.",0
"I've seen the reviews by others, and concur that the software lacks the bells and whistles of the newer full Roxio product (ver 7). BUT ... if you're looking for some simple features that don't hog a lot of drive space or CPU cycles, this earlier product (ver 6) fits the bill. I've been looking for a simple packet-writing program to drag-and-drop files for archiving or transfer between systems [your old floppy 'sneakernet'], and it's just right for that simple task. Window's XP file transfer is just miserable, as it treats a document like graphics material, storing it to disk, then writing track-by-track with balloons and other distractions. This package lets you format and write/delete to RW discs without hassle. Better yet, in ""Custom"" installation you can pick and choose the functions you need, and forget about the fancy 'Control Center'. For my simple needs it works like a charm at minimal cost.",0

I had always bragged that Macs were immune.  I purchased a version of Norton Anti-Virus and within a day, the troubles stopped.  Since then, I never leave my Mac unprotected.  This version seems to be an improvement over other versions and I feel better having it on my computer.  I now have Leopard OX so I wanted to make sure the program could protect it.",0

"Photomatix Pro 6 is an excellent post photography program for HDR photos. The program has a bit of a learning curve but nothing beyond the capabilities of anyone somewhat experienced in Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. It's a stand-alone program and a Lightroom plug-in, too, for combining photos into HDR, with a huge array of available adjustments. And it's ability to transform the ordinary into the spectacular is nothing short of amazing.

The Pro 6 version of Photomatix is considerably different from earlier versions I have been familiar with and it compares very favorably against other HDR programs I have used, e.g. Photoshop CC, HDR Efex Pro, and Luminar, to name a few. And it can be acquired at a 15% discount, too, if you look around.",0

"I have always had good luck with McAfee products, and although the founder of the company is now being sought as a murder suspect, it doesn't mean his software is not solid.  This was easy to install, ran well, and did the job.  As one of the standard-bearers of the anti-virus software franchises, you can't go wrong with McAfee.  I have two home computers, and the multi-user feature worked well.  I was able to install and run auto-updates no problem.

I am currently running this version on my home machines, and have not had a problem with either viruses or system performance.

I can recommend this or other McAfee products without hesitation.",0
"The thing I like the most about the AVG Anti-Virus and Spyware software is that it runs in the background without bothering me and most of the time I don't even know it's there.  I've used an earlier version of this software for just over a year, so when I saw this package being offered I ordered it for my husband's new PC which is running Windows 7.  I like not having all the advertising pop-ups that I've had to deal with on other anti-virus programs and I also like that it doesn't seem to affect the speed of my computer when booting like some other titles have done in the past.  I also like the fact that it installs very easily, just a few clicks of the mouse and you're on your way.  What is under the hood may be complex, but from where I sit it's very easy to use and I've never had any problems with a virus.

This product comes with technical support although I've never had any reason to use it.  It's pretty simple and straightforward.  Another thing I like is it scans your downloads of music, files, and applications and does it in the background without slowing you down and it's behind the scenes where you don't even realize it's happening.  You also get free upgrades automatically and scans automatically on a schedule that you can decide.  You can also do a scan whenever you want by simply opening the AVG control center.  There's a thing called LinkScanner SurfShield which ensures every website you visit is safe and you get a message if there's a question so you can avoid the site or override the software and take your chances.

All in all, it's a great security program.  Fast, easy to use, doesn't bother you with a bunch of ads for add-on products and you are hardly aware that it's there working for you.  Best of all, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",0
At this sale price you cannot beat it.  I have been using Norton products for over 20 years and always find great deals before I renew.

"I wanted to give plenty of time to explore the many features of Norton 360. Having used the Norton Security Suite, I wanted to see how well the extra features would work. Norton 360 installs fast and the default settings provide you with a secured PC. You don't have to do much tweaking, but you should check out the many options available. Norton 360 provides virus, spyware and firewall features for PC Security, Identity Protection for online banking and shopping (with an identity safe as well for secure logins),Backup features with 2GB of included online storage, (more space is available at extra cost), and PC tuneup features including disk optimization, file optimization, diagnostic scans, a startup manager to shut off non-necessary programs that can slow your system down and a registry cleanup to fix bad entries in your Windows Registry. The PC tune up features were the real draw for this set, which sets it apart from the regular security suite. It also has rootkit and botnet protection to keep your PC safe from these attacks. I will break this into the four sections to make it easier to comment on the features.

PC Security
Norton takes care of updating automatically, though you can run Liveupdate manually if you choose. The frequent updates take little time, but keep your PC protected and you don't have to reboot very much. You can run scan options for comprehensive (longer) and quick (shorter) time frames. If your PC is idle, Norton will automatically do a comprehensive background scan and fix any issues automatically. The option to delete temp files and browsing history are also available with the comprehensive scans. I recommend running a quick scan after browsing the net and running a comprehensive one at least once a week. While updates keep your PC updated, it is important for you to run frequent scans to look for things that may not be caught by a quick scan alone.

Identity Protection
Norton will ""learn"" your browsing habits to configure options for banking and shopping sites. If you choose to use the Identity Safe, you will need to provide a password for secure logins. I use the excellent Roboform for login and password protection, so I did not use their Identity safe.

Backup
Backup is included with 2GB of online storage with more storage available for a nominal cost. Setup is easy. You should check your options to keep space within the provided limit unless you have opted for more storage. The easy walk through will show you how much your system and update everytime you change a location feature (selecting documents, music, pictures, etc). Once set up, Backup will remind you to take the time to backup your important files. The first time will be a bit long, but subsequent backups will go quickly. If you don't backup for several weeks, Norton will not allow you to run a scan will backup first. This is a great reminder for people who don't make backups a part of their computing experience. You can also restore files. This was much easier to use than I expected.

PC Tuneup
The PC Tuneup section is great. It will cleanup your temp files, Internet Explorer history and run scans to check PC health and fix errors. The disk optimization also includes disk degfragging. I don't run the disk defragger since I use the excellent Diskeeper program wich provides more advanced defrag options, such as boot-time, page file and master file table defragging, checkdisk options and constant system defraggs. (Yes girls can be geeks too!)The registry cleanup is easy to use. The Windows Registry is heart of your PC and all programs write to this location. The Registry IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS or those unfamiliar with software programming. Messing with the Registry CAN DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER. Fortunately, a number of great programs can fix errors which can slow your PC with a simple scan. Norton's Registry cleaner does a great job, simply click to run a scan and it takes care of the issues for you.

All options are available in easy to use Windows and have clear selections to view tasks or settings. You won't need to visit these often, as Norton takes good care of your PC without much input for you. While it does, it is important for you to take the time to actually run some of the scans and take a proactive stance to keep yourself safe. I highly recommend Norton 360, powerful and easy to use tools and protection for your PC.",0
"item arrived timely, securely packaged. Program started and loaded properly, converting my old files (2011) to the new 2014 format. navigation is improved, as well displaying the tree with more branches.",0
"I used KIS 2006 successfully for a year after being fed-up with Norton.  At renewal time I was forced into KIS 2007.  It was a disaster (see my KIS 2007 review).

After working with their technicians, I was led to KIS 2009, which was in beta at the time. I installed it with much trepidation (was I embarking on another time-sink?), but I didn't have many alternatives (the devil you know vs the one you don't know).

I was pleasantly surprised that it installed without much problem. Subsequently I've installed it easily on two other computers. It has been working flawlessly for six months.

The overhead seems to be minimal (at least relative to Norton) and it doesn't interfere with installing new programs.  It seems to offer a lot of information and reports for geek types, yet isn't intrusive for those of us who want to minimize administraive issues.

Perhaps not perfect, but it works for me.",0

"For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 (Family Edition) is bargain priced.  First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.

I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 - for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.

I'm permitted to update this review, and I will if I experience any problems.  Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy.

12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.  After the install and update, I ran a full scan and found a missed virus on one computer, a network threat and a privacy threat on a second computer.  This is not good, but it could be worse.  Neither the virus or the other missed threats caused me any harm.  And Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 is an incredable improvement over anything they have ever produced - possibly better than anything on store shelves.

If I could I would change this review rating to 4 stars.",0
"I've given this five stars not as a review of Windows 8 itself, but of the upgrade product and its installation process.

Basically if you know you want to upgrade to Windows 8, then you can rest assured that this is a good way to do it assuming you're on Windows 7 to begin with.

If you hate Windows 8's guts, then you won't be interested in this to begin with. Personally I have been hoping that 8.1 would resolve the issues, but so far that's sounding like only a partial solution. I can survive in Windows 8, but on a desktop system it's a struggle to get used to the ""tablet style"" user interface that it forces on you each time you want to start a program. Fortunately there are 3rd party addons that will restore the Start button and bypass the Metro UI at startup.

"Dell OEM Windows XP Professional RTM through SP1a is almost exactly like retail except for one small and one big difference. Windows XP of this type can install on multiple Dell PCs with minimal effort (provided you have stuff like drivers, and need a base service pack and not full updating. Full updating spoils the trick, because Microsoft grew wise to it. To explain this miracle to you, I have 4 Dell business PCs, a Dell OptiPlex GX400 from August 2001, running the RTM version (which does include the Microsoft Runtime for Java-Wikipedia is wrong on that) and it is only one of four PCs to run XP in this fashion. Windows XP Professional is installed using the same CD but updated to SP1a (but with the RTM having the Microsoft Runtime for Java, it's virtually SP1 original) on a Dell OptiPlex GX270, one of the ones that is supposed to have bad capacitors, but hasn't failed me yet, but then the fun continues. The GX270 has some updates for Firefox 3.6 to run on it, and it was no problem installing those updates.

Windows XP Professional is installed via the same CD onto a Dell Latitude D505 I bought to be my vintage laptop after the Clamshell iBook G3's hard disk died, and it is upgraded to SP2 flawlessly.

Windows XP Professional is lastly installed from this same CD onto a Dell OptiPlex 745 with a Pentium D CPU at 3.4GHz, and it is updated to base SP3 plus .NET Framework 2.0 on the 745, and they all installed and self-activated and as long as I don't do Windows Update on them, they all don't require their Windows XP CD-keys affixed to their cases (the GX400 had a $150 Microsoft OEM System Builder Windows XP Professional CD-key stuck on him as insurance should full updating be required in the future.

I am a computer nut, and I like tracing the history of a given OS back through the ages. Therefore, with my Dell OEM Windows XP Professional RTM CD, I can sit there and use the computer brand, models, and types out of that brand with those models I already desired to use.

Believe it or not, I am typing this review using one of the machines thus configured, specifically the GX270 Dell OptiPlex running Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 1a.

Oh, and the browser I am using is Internet Explorer 6 SP1, so you know it's vintage.

This discovery is simply the most revolutionary thing to happen since XP was released. Oh, and by the way, here's the time for the little tidbit:

Dell OEM CDs of Windows XP Professional SP2 and later don't do this. They require a CD-key like any other version of XP. And if you get one of the XP Professional discs compatible with this money and effort saving trick, you can rest assured that like a Microsoft version of XP with only one minor exception-a Dell Solution Center button in the lower right corner of the Start menu above the Shut Down or Turn Off Computer button, again except for the fact that in order to get self-activation, you must be using Dell OEM hardware with a Dell BIOS (when the computer shows the progress bar, if it has a big Dell logo on it, you are good to go).

Again, with this CD trick, Microsoft can't fuss about what hardware you have changed or not, as long as the BIOS remains Dell branded-or if you update Windows, to where Windows is automatically updated.

This gives you leeway to run that cantakerous old peripheral (say a HP LaserJet 6P or a vintage weather monitoring system) that Windows Vista/7/8 just doesn't support.

Same way with software. If you want to run a vintage copy of Adobe Acrobat-say 7.0 or below, or a vintage copy of Adobe Photoshop (say 7.0 or below), you can, and buy a Vista/7/8 computer or a Mac for what they are good for, which is being modern Internet terminals.

So while this may not be retail, given the appropriate precautions, it's infinitely better than retail, unlimited installs given Dell hardware with Dell BIOS, and unlimited hardware changes (again, given Dell BIOS) and no bloatware. You are off and running with nothing more than the CD and burnt discs of the appropriate service pack or packs.",0

"I started exploring the capabilities of of Autodesk's AutoCAD Revit LT even before the software landed on my doorstep.  That included talking to experts in the field, customer service, including tech.  I have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-2013/dp/B007MF77R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD 2013</a>&nbsp;by Autodesk and my previous review/overview is directly below this one.  In the overview, I make mention to useful references and its numerous improvements over the 2012 issue. This should enable small businesses to decide what their company needs.  One of the questions I wanted to know about the AutoCAD Revit LT was what exactly was included in the subscription, something that no one at Autodesk seemed to know.  One benefit, that I found by default was the outstanding access to technical assistance.  I went online, got myself into a queue and received a call within minutes.

Back to the subscription plan before I head off into specs and feature of Autodesk's AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 in comparison to the AutoCAD LT 2013.  There are three levels of support that Autodesk offers via subscription:  Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority.  The subscription included with the purchase of this particular version of AutoCAD Revit LT is the Basic.  If you wish to upgrade your level, you may do so by contacting Autodesk directly, purchase online, or through a local Autodesk reseller.  This was one seemingly simple question that took me several weeks to get answered.  As I mentioned before, the web and phone access to technical questions is prompt and excellent.

All software, regardless of subscription purchase or not, includes what is called Up-and-Ready.  It does include installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables.  You will also receive phone and online resource support.  I'll outline the benefits of Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority.  This will be a rather lengthy review and you can simply skip over the parts you are not interested in.  Just glancing at the benefits will definitely give you an idea as to the type of support and expertise you'll have at your fingertips with a subscription.

SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS:

Enterprise Priority:

*  You will have access to around the clock telephone support for severity 1 issues.

*  You will be assigned a support account manager who will personally support requests, work through escalations, and oversee your account needs.

*  Proactive support services are customized to meet the individual needs of clients, ""including operational assessments and project health checks.""

*  You'll be able to interact with some of Autodesk's senior leaders and get a chance to meet them at Autodesk University and other company sponsored events.

*  If you'd like you'll be able to participate in and offer your input into beta projects.

*  You'll have an Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) professional membership with which you can have access to ""developer support and training.""

*  You will be able to have an unlimited number of ""named callers"" who can contact Autodesk support.

*  You will able to reach back in time and obtain resolution of severity 1 problems in ""previous releases.""

Enterprise Priority & Advanced:

*  You have what Autodesk had dubbed ""Priority Response Targets.""  In other words, you're moved to the head of the line and get answers to your questions quicker.

*  Remote desktop assistance is available to help you troubleshoot and resolve problems that may arise.

*  Support for the application programming interface (API) is available.  You can contact ""Autoface Developer Support with technical issues related to application programming interfaces (API).  I found the ability to access this support is superb.

*  24 x 5 telephone support from Autodesk specialists (access depends on what time zone you are in).

*  You can ""escalate question"" on an online community support forum.  Immediate assistance is available.  It definitely is because I tried out this feature.  My question was not one that could be answered, but I was pointed in another direction with phone numbers.

*  You can access updated ""webcast training seminars,"" a must if you encounter problems.

Enterprise Priority, Advanced, and Basic:

*  Phone support from Autodesk during local business hours, once again dependent on your time zone.

*  If you try to access online community support and do not received a response within 24 hours, your request is escalated.

*  You have access to web support via community support forums and you can ""submit requests"" through the Subscription Center.

*  There is an online knowledge base ""containing a wealth of valuable information.""  For example, there are several online videos and tutorials.  Some are on the Autodesk site while others can be accessed through YouTube.

*  You have access to Up-and-Ready which includes installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables.

I did receive a Comparison Matrix, something that you probably won't receive when you order Autodesk AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 or AutoCAD LT 2013.  This comparison really gives one an idea between the capabilities each has to offer, information a small business needs to know prior to investing in one or the other.  AutoCAD LT 2013 has only four of the features, two in documentation and two in collaboration.  I've decided replicate the Comparison Matrix (Copyright Autodesk, 2012) below, making note of the features AutoCAD LT 2013 has in parenthesis.

Autodesk Revit LT 2012 and AutoCAT LT 2013

Comparison Matrix

DOCUMENTATION

*  Create documentation with 2D drafting and detailing tools (AutoCAT LT 2013)

*  Place annotations, and dimensions to communicate additional design information (AutoCAT LT 2013)

*  Automate the creation of schedules based on building components

*  Automatically calculate and track material quantities in cost estimates

*  Automatically update every documentation view when revisions are made to your design

3D MODELING

*  Use specialized architectural modeling tools for Building Information Modeling to concurrently design and document

VISUALIZATION AND PRESENTATION

*  Easily generate 3D  orthographic or perspective views from any angle of the model to visualize the space

There have been numerous improvements to AutoCAD 2013, some very subtle such as a minor font size increase to major ones such as the ""Annotation Monitor"" and the addition of Cloud.

Hopefully, a simple overview of new/improved updates from AutoCAD LT 2012 and previous editions listed below will help make your purchasing decision.

WHAT'S NEW:

+  A new ""Welcome"" screen (once called the ""Exchange""). It is indeed welcoming and helps you quickly access your work.  There is also quick access to Facebook, Twitter,and AutoDesk360.

+  The ability to strike through text, leaders and dimensions (documentation), in addition to bold, italic, underscore, and overscore.

+  The command bar has been relocated to the bottom of the screen.  It is interactive only when you work.

+  A current history ""floats"" above the command bar (you can undo easily) showing what you have just done, including dimensions.  As you work it will gradually be removed.

+  You can draw and your line(s) will go behind the bar to the bottom of the page sans interruption.

+  ""Annotation Monitor"" was added.  This helps correct your drawing scale.  You can make notes, annotate, scale, you can associate dimensions, etc.

+  There are now options for the radius of a circle that can be accessed by typing C + enter.  You can specify the center point or radius and click your options (you no longer have to type them in).

+  The 3D modeling tools have been improved with greater detailing, including section views.

+  The history can be accessed by hitting F2.

+  DWG file format.

+  You can access online resources through the Autodesk Exchange Apps (many are free).",0
"I purchased a new laptop and it came with Vista and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security 2007.  Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.

The good:

- The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.

- The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.

- The controls are easy to manage and tweak.

The bad:

- After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.

- 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.

I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.  This should reduce the probability of problems and needing to interact with Symantec itself.",1
"COREL ULEAD VIDEO STUDIO is a digital movie editing software program which is easy to use. In addition to my personal use to product review it, by himself my twelve year old taught himself to use it to make YouTube videos from recordings of him playing video games and made title pages and subtitles.

We wanted to use this product to create short movies for fun and to edit family home videos for better viewing experiences (cut out the garbage and to summarize). This product is fine for that use.

We also can add text such as titles and textual information in the video.

I was first introduced to 360 as a beta tester and enjoyed testing the product. I like the ease of installation. I like Norton products and have used them for years.

"I have used just about every version of Windows. These are my observations.

1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.

2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that ""just works"" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.

3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.

4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.

Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and ""just works"". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.",0
"I'm the CTO of an IT company who uses a mac, but needs Windows.  So I've been using VMware and Parallels alternately for years.  I had most recently been on Parallels 7, and when I upgraded to the Parallels 8 Beta, I had no problems.  No issues.  The migration was fine, and after the upgrade, the VM ran beautifully.  I'm on an SSD so any benefits to the claims of faster booting isn't something I'd really notice, as my system was already booting in less than 15 seconds anyway.  The tools installed fine, dragging and dropping from my physical laptop's desktop to the VM's desktop and vice versa worked great.  Publishing the apps from windows into Mac worked without any hitches as well, but I only did that for testing as I don't run my VM's in that mode - I prefer the windowed mode to keep everything separated.
Only glitch I've hit is one that's been around forever that I've hit in both VMWare and Parallels, and that's the random hiccup with the networking, where it doesn't connect when you have it set to ""default adapter"" and you have to go to the VM tools and force it to use physically the card you're on.  With my previous Macbook Pro it was annoying as I had the gigabit onboard and the wireless, and I changed from one to the other depending on whose network I was on and whether there was wireless available.  But I'm on the new Retina MBP which doesn't have a built in Ethernet, so I can at least leave it set physically to my wireless and be working.  It's easy enough to remember when I pull out the thunderbolt gigabit adapter to change the settings if needed.
All in all, another rock solid product.  If it weren't for that little glitch sometimes with the adapter settings if you're trying to bridge the network, I'd be great.",0
"Worked as it was supposed to work. I was able to do the upgrade without affecting my programs or data files. The Virtual XP worked quite well and made my transition to Win7 easy.  I no longer need the virtual XP, but really appreciated it when I needed the transition. Some of the advanced features of the Win Pro version with respect to networking are quite useful. Altogether, a very useful upgrade",0
"This game begins with you, as Nancy Drew, invited by the Hardy Boys to solve a strange 100 year old mystery: What happened to Jake Hurley? Lori Girard, a wannabe actress who will do anything for attention, invited a world-known detective, a television star, a romance novelist, and the Hardy Boys to help discover anything that will lead to Jake Hurley's mine, which no one ever found. But when Lori mysteriously disappears, the real personalities of these people come out. Nancy Drew, with the help of the Hardy Boys, discovers the real reason why one passenger wanted to find Jake Hurley's abandoned mine.

Overall, it was fun to play, but hard to follow the story, which surprised me because usually HerInteractive does a very nice job with the story. The game was not overly easy, but not overly difficult either. I found my self going online only twice for help. And, as always, the graphics and the music is amazing! Another great job HerInteractive! 5 Stars!",0
"I walked away from Symantec products three years ago and have been very  pleased with the the performance of Trend Micro's products. PC-Cillin 2007 is no exception.

I not only run PC-Cillin at home but also use Trend Micro Client-Server SMB at fifteen franchise small business locations with the same great performance at forty percent of the life cycle cost of Norton Corporate Security.

"If you're looking for solid video editing at a reasonable price, you've come to the right place.  The user interface on this is fairly intuitive and there are a lot of options for editing your video, adding special effects, etc.  My brother-in-law, who is a video professional, tells me that this is severely under-powered for professionals.  But it is more than sufficient for my home video editing and I expect it would also be more than sufficient for most entry-level YouTube videographers too.",0

"The Netgear ProSAFE 8-port Gigabit Click Switch is a office-space networking game changer. The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This ""smart-switch"" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.

Design:
One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.

The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.

The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.

The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.

The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no ""power brick"" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.

The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.

Configuration:
I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.

' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.
' Change the password - The default password is ""password"", so change it to something better!

The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.

The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:
' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)
' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)
' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).
' Port by port Rate limiting
' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a ""disable"" setting to turn a port off if desired)
' Port by port Broadcast Filtering
' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)
' Multicast control via IGMP snooping
' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)

Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.

Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.

Green Power Use:
The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or ""dumb"" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.

Support:
I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.

Conclusions:
The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.

The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many ""dumb"" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.

I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.

I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.

Hope this helps someone!",0
this operating system is by far the greatest made by Microsoft,0
Norton has always been the best and always will be in my opinion.  It was very easy to download this on my laptop and get it working. I haven't put it on my phone yet so that should be interesting. Will update my review once I have a chance to try it on my phone.,0
"So thankful I can read my Kindle books outside of the Kindle. This one for PC works well, is intuitive and handy. Wherever I leave off on either my Kindle or iPad, this application automatically detects and gives me the option to catch up. Well done and easy to use. Easy to read, too. Easily customized just enough to matter.",0
"This sort of software comes with a significant learning curve, but Corel's habit of including tutorials puts a dent in that difficulty.  This title comes with a lot of design art; borders, clipart, design elements, fonts, etc.  This is an excellent program for design layout and vector editing.  If you're new at this sort of software, work through the tutorials and you will be pretty amazed at what you can accomplish.

I particularly liked the option to modify each individual portion of the image.  For example, I tried painting a few Kanji (Japanese written language characters).  Each stroke was individually adjustable, so if I flubbed the proportions a bit, I could fix the parts rather than start over.  I also enjoy the option to work in separate layers for similar reasons.",0
"I have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I have found it easy to use.  I don't usually skip sections.  Just easier for me to go through each section.  No problem importing my data from the prior year.  A long while back I switched to another product because of calculations errors Turbo Tax made and while it guarantees the calculations it was such a hassle to prove to them it wasn't worth it so I switched.  I came back a few years later and there was no issue importing my data from a competing product.

I like the guided menus.  And this year's product seems to be just as easy to use and helpful.  This Premier product does offer features that use.  It may be more than others may need like stocks and bonds, for instance.

While it comes with one state download, it does not include a state e-file.  That gets to be expensive.  As is buying another state download which I need to do.  I have had issues with e-filing my resident state because Intuit did not include a copy of the other state return which is a requirement.  So I don't e-file and mail it in.  They said they would fix that, but I haven't seen anything that says they did.

All in all I like this product and it makes my life much easier.  I remember the days of taking pen to the 1040 and other forms and using a calculator... talk about stress.  I recommend this particular edition if you need the financial guidance for your investments.  Otherwise try a less expensive version.  You should find it very easy and intuitive.",0
"This review is entirely from the perspective of people looking at Photoshop alternatives, now that Adobe has switched to a monthly fee model with Creative Cloud.

I use to do computer graphics and fine arts more than a decade ago, but I don't work in that field, and so I only actually need to use a high end graphics program every few months or so.  I've used Photoshop for more than 10 years, but now that Adobe has gone to Creative Cloud with a monthly rental but no purchase option, I need an alternative.  I don't do graphics often enough to justify a monthly fee on the Adobe Creative Cloud plan, and I have concerns about whether I will be able to open files years into the future unless I can own the software.  My personal alternative is the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GIMP has a clunky user interface.  And, I also recommend software for a small university library where students and staff are also looking for something for occasional use.

Corel Painter 2015 has a decent user interface.  I was able to do simple edits quickly and intuitively.  I was also able to use the User Guide to quickly find and follow instructions for applying a mask.  There are a lot of options, because you can do a lot for it, so I think it's better for someone who has used a high-end graphics program before or who wants to be able to do more.  It was easy to find instructions for using the software.  There is a big long PDF User Guide, tutorials on YouTube (this is officially how Corel makes the tutorials available), and by Googling I could find websites where people talked about using the software.  So, you will be able to quickly find instructions on doing common tasks in Corel Painter.  One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.  I won't necessarily be able to go back to a tutorial a few years from now, since I can't store them with the software.

All in all, this is perfectly adequate software for editing digital images, and has a range that goes all the way up to fine arts.  There is a 30 day free trial to demo the software, and you can get this from Corel's website to try the software out.",0
"I've used WordPerfect Office for a few years now and have never had any huge issues. With X7, I haven't had any issues at all. Works with MS Office, easy to use, intuitive, and has everything you need at the click of a button. Excellent! Highly recommended.",0
"I bought the 06 version and loved it.
I downloaded the trial version for 08 to see if it is worth the new price, afterall, I bought the 06 just not so long ago (maybe less than 3 months).
The new Numbers and Pages are just wonderful.  It is so much more intuitive than MS Office.  I have the Office for Mac and I have been using Office in Windows for the past 10 years.  But ever since I started using Pages and Keynote, and now Numbers, I have to say hands down, iWork 08 is near perfection for 99.9% of all office needs.
I wish there were even more templates for all three apps.  But with the included templates, one could modify them to create new templates fairly easy and quick.
My trial period is coming to an end in a couple of weeks.  I will buy the iWork 08 for sure.",0

"Nuance got it right with Dragon 4. I have used Dragon on my PC for more than 12 years and had been one of its greatest boosters. The initial release of Dragon 3  for Mountain Lion  was quirky, but Nuance improved it with subsequent upgrades.

I have installed version 4 (4.0.2). 4.0.2 works great with the latest upgraded version of new Pages. I never tried Word on my Mac. I am a great fan of WordPerfect which I use on my PC. This comment was dictated with Dragon 4.  I think the major problem was the initial release of version 3  was that it was released very shortly after the initial release of Mountain Lion.  Apple subsequently released interim upgrades for Mountain Lion & Nuance  eventually caught up with it.

Nuance  did not release version 4  until almost 6 months after Mavericks was released.  There were subsequent upgrades of Mavericks  which eliminated some of its quirks.  For version 4,  Nuance waited until they could get it right.

l have used Dragon for more than 12 years on my PC and other software made by Nuance. The initial release of Dragon 3 for Mac was quirky on Mountain Lion but Nuance improved it with upgrades for that version. Version 4 was apparently designed to work with Mavericks and it works very well for me.",0
"This program is compatible with Windows 7 and 8. You also need access to the internet to activate it online, and for online services. This program works well for burning dvds and blu-rays, but I also appreciate it for the unique Live Screen Capture feature, which is helpful for creating tutorials especially. As a video editing software, it's high quality and supports 4k ultra HD output, as well as 3D features. It also includes seventeen tracks to choose from to add music, as well as a music and speech cleaner. The Pinnacle Studio Ultimate is also more advanced than the Studio and Studio Plus editions, precisely because of its support for blu-rays and 4k ultra HD--which is important for me. Overall, I found this program to be high-quality with a ton of options to choose from.",0
"This is my favorite of the first 20 Nancy Drew games.  Seriously, it was so much fun, and I was constantly getting chills from the scary storyline.  I was really needing this game as before this game HERinteractive wasn't really doing too great with their games.

Story-Your neighbor has asked you to go to England to check on her daughter, Linda.  Linda has suddenly started hiding behind a curtain in her bedroom and refused to let anyone see her.  She has also started to have temper tantrums, which according to her mother are totally unlike her.  You soon realize that something supernatural may be behind this sudden change in behavior.

Graphics-Okay, so these didn't get too much better, but they are still good.  All the spooky areas are dark, while the mansion is always lit up, and I did find the artwork rather well done.

Sound-The voice acting was very good in my opinion as was the music.  There are lots of songs in this game, I thought, and I liked them all.

Gameplay-Everything is the same except you don't leave the manor ever and the puzzles are HARD.  This was the first game where I found there were tons of puzzles and they were challenging without being frustrating.  Whenever you get stuck you can ask a parrot for hints, but you cannot call Bess and George in this game although you can call Ned.

Fun-This game is so fun, and it is really scary, too.  I just want to mention that some people will not want to play this game because it does talk of witches, werewolves, alchemy, and rituals.  I didn't find it satanic or anything, but I think some people will want to skip this game if they don't like things like that.

Length-I must have played this 1 or 2 months!  It was so fun!  And, still, when I replay it, it takes me 12-15 hours to finish.  It is really long, and I loved that!

This is the perfect PC game that I recommend to everyone except those who are concerned about the above mentioned.  And, of course, small children should NOT play this game, but it is my favorite Nancy Drew game, if not my favorite PC game!",0
"Even though I have a remote CD drive I can connect to my Dell Mini netbook, it was nice not having to haul it out and hook it up. The box comes with instructions and an authorization code to get you to the McAfee website where you can download the latest version of the software. My main concerns were protecting a laptop and netbook running Windows 7, and for that application this is an ideal solution.

I found the packaging to be pretty effective, although there are times when we find ourselves needing to install anti-virus software as a remedial measure because a virus has already prevented us from accessing the web; if that's your situation, this package isn't for you. When you arrive at McAfee's website you register yourself - one user - and you can download the software on up to five devices, including PC, laptop, netbook, tablet or mobile. Total download and installation time, including download, took me approximately 20 minutes and was straightforward on both a laptop and a netbook running Windows OS.  McAfee recommends a high speed internet connection for this.

Having used other companies' protection software in the past, I come back to McAfee because I find them effective and unobtrusive.  A lot of what this does runs in the background, which is fine with me, I don't want to know it's there.  I switched from Norton years ago because my employer McAfee for their mobile workforce and I found I preferred the McAfee product.

This version of software comes with anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-phishing, anti-spam, content filtering, firewall, and website safety ratings available for any and all devices being used PC, MAC, tablet or smartphone.  Additional features available for PC only include data encryption, home network defense, online back up, file shredder, instant message monitoring and program blocking.  Monitor Online Activities is available for PC and MAC. Available only for mobile devices and tablets are mobile device lock, remote wipe data from mobile device, back up and restore mobile data, locate and track mobile devices, and uninstall protection.

Supported OS include Windows XP SP3+ (32 bit), Windows Vista SP1 (32 / 64 bit), Windows 7 (32 / 64 bit), Mac OS X 10.5+, Google Android 2.1+ (smartphones and tablets), Mac iOS (iPhone software sold separately at the Apple App store), Blackberry 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 5.0, 6.0, Symbian S60 3rd & 5th edition,  Supported browsers for anti-phishing include Internet Explorer 7.0+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.0+ and Chrome 6.0+.

Outlook XP+, Eudora 6.0+, Thunderbird 1.5+, McAfee anti-spam also supports other POP3 email clients (without SSL) and web accounts.",0
"I am not a Biblical scholar whatsoever not have I ever played one on TV.  I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible.  GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That's a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.  There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons.  I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording.  Additionally, GLO sends its audience updates for contents and historical facts.",0
"We get the upgrade every year, and, while the changes are not huge, the program is excellent to begin with, and they do improve it every time.  This is no exception.

This has always been the best genealogy program, in my opinion, and it still is.",0

"This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon. This Gigabit switch (and it's larger ProSafe Plus kin) has port mirroring and other advanced functions for comprehensive service quality, diagnosing, and monitoring of network traffic on-the-cheap. It's impossible to find this stuff in the average, everyday un-managed switches at the lower end of the price pool where this one also swims.

To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0

"I was reluctant to move to a new platform after using Office 2003 for so long, but now I am wondering why it took me so long!  Admittedly, you have to do some head scratching from time to time to figure out where things are...how do to what you were used to doing without even thinking in the older version. Doing a copy/paste activity is a good example of this.

So, there is a learning curve to this, which can be daunting.  But, if you're patient and take the time to learn, you will find that the process of editing or making changes eventually becomes much faster (less clicks) than the previous formats.

I really don't mind, even like, the ribbon feature.  You can customize it so it only includes what you use the most often.

Also, other reviews have mentioned this, but be aware that upon installation you should selcted ""customize"" instead of ""upgrade,"" else you will loose certain programs in the previous version (in my case, MS Outlook 2003, which I had to reinstall).

Although I cannot comment on any upgrade benefit from 2007, I consider this a very worthwile upgrade from 2003.",0
"Installed Leopard on three computers, a Mac Pro 2.66Ghz, MacBook Pro 2.4 Ghz, and an old 1.5Ghz G4 Powerbook.  I encountered no problems upgrading even though I chose the ""Upgrade"" option.  I did this because I knew I had avoided installing programs with haxies.  If you have done this be sure and choose the ""Archive and Install"" option instead to avoid having the known problem of a blue screen on initial reboot occur.  The new features in Leopard look and work great.  I am extremely happy with it.  The only glaring problem I see with 10.5.0 is that repairing permissions does not work as well as it did in 10.4. The progress indicator does not work properly and the process takes 2-3 times as long.  I am sure Apple will correct this in a software update.",0

It was easy to install, and at the end of installing it, it gave me the choice of installing Windows or waiting. There are instruction if you choose to wait on installing Windows. You can stand an earlier OS, but Windows 8 was the one I got at. It is fairly easy to go between the Mac and Windows. The only difficulty so far is getting use to dealing with Windows again, it has been a while for me plus getting use to Windows 8 which is different than Vista.

There is a couple of ways you can have it set up, but they are all easily switch able between Windows and Mac. I have it set up so everything stayed together. You can for the most part keep Windows in a window of it's own or you can have it in something called ""Coherence"", which has the windows version of the dock on the bottom. But it is easy to go between the windows and mac.

"The Good:

*Simple to use; user-friendly interface.
*An ability to create multiple vaults(from 50MB to 4GB) to keep your hidden files organized.
*Easy Access through your System Tray.
*Auto-Lock feature provides extra security if you leave your PC and forget to lock your vault(s.)

The Bad:

*Not compatible with Windows Vista 64-bit(at the time of this review.)

The Bottom Line:

Finally a simple program to hide the files you don't want others to see.  The program starts by asking you the master password.  After that, each vault you name and create asking you for vault's password.  This is a good feature if more than one person share the same PC.  Both of you must know the master password; However, each one of you can set a separate password for your vaults.  Another great feature is the auto-lock feature.  You can instruct the program to auto-lock your vault after assigned number of minutes of idle time or even when a screen saver comes on.

"This review is based on release candidate 2 (RC2). Can I say anything but Kudos? The new interface is intuitive to the max. It's a big step above former versions of Windows and even a cut above Macs. Stability is, well, I can't get it to crash. Compatibility is phenomenal. DOS, Win 3.1 and Win9x programs run without a problem (remember, this is based on the NT file system and kernel, not the DOS-based file system and kernel). This is what Windows was meant to be when version 1.0 came out. OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it. Most people will be satisfied with the home version. If you have a business or are a real computer geek, then you may want the Pro version. Installation is a snap (takes about an hour) and, if you decide that it's not for you, it uninstalls easily.
For me there's no going back. I think that you'll feel the same way once you try it.",0

"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC.
Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.",0
"This game begins with you, as Nancy Drew, invited by the Hardy Boys to solve a strange 100 year old mystery: What happened to Jake Hurley? Lori Girard, a wannabe actress who will do anything for attention, invited a world-known detective, a television star, a romance novelist, and the Hardy Boys to help discover anything that will lead to Jake Hurley's mine, which no one ever found. But when Lori mysteriously disappears, the real personalities of these people come out. Nancy Drew, with the help of the Hardy Boys, discovers the real reason why one passenger wanted to find Jake Hurley's abandoned mine.

Overall, it was fun to play, but hard to follow the story, which surprised me because usually HerInteractive does a very nice job with the story. The game was not overly easy, but not overly difficult either. I found my self going online only twice for help. And, as always, the graphics and the music is amazing!

"I have been using the Corel PaintShop Pro software since its earliest version and it is still the main photo-editing software I use everyday among other photo-editing software including the PhotoShop. What I like about the Corel PaintShop Pro software are its ease of use and the wealth of features for general quick /easy and the more advanced photo editing.

Here are some of the features I use most often for quick editing :

- smart photo fix : allows a 1-click photo enhancement with real time review and adjustment to our liking
- various photo brushes (clone brush, scratch remover etc) for quick touch-up of the photos
- white balance adjustment for the perfect color balancing
- skin smoothing which makes us look years younger

The software comes with a wealth of advanced features including layering, masking, vector objects, stack filters, raw processing and a variety of photo effects.

This latest version is noticeably faster including the program start-up and the more CPU intensive tasks like skin smoothing and such. It also comes with new features such as magic move which allows us to move an object with an intelligent algorithm to fill the background. There are also bonus CDs including the Perfect Effects, Corel AfterShot, Perfectly Clear SE, and creative collection which enhance our capabilities for photo editing.

For those who are looking a reasonably priced photo editing software with easy-to-use interface and advanced features, this is one to consider.",0

"My wife has a 5 year old PC that's been nothing but a source of problems. It seems every time that I sit down to use my Mac, which never causes me problems, I get the call from her to come over and try to repair an issue with her PC. The basic problem has been that it constantly freezes up, it's always running slowly and about 50% of the time when she tries to open a window, all she sees is the spinning wheel.

After doing some research this past Sunday, I came across this product. Since I wanted to try it right away, I opted for the download version. In all honesty, my expectations bordered on zero that this would help to resolve any of her ongoing issues. I was wrong. After configuring the CCleaner Professional System Optimization Tool to perform regular maintenance, I tried to use it manually for the first time. I selected cookies that I wanted to keep and left the rest in the storage area provided for this. To my complete surprise, after selecting the cookies that I wanted and performing the recommended clean up operations, the computer actually runs like it was new.

The slow speeds are a thing of the past, there's no more spinning wheel and freeze ups have been eliminated. I've tried products like this before, yet this is the first one that actually does what it says it will do. In addition, the price is a lot lower than similar products, and it's a one time purchase. The download version was $5 more than the one sold on Amazon, but even if it had been 5 times more expensive, it would have been worth it. The bottom line is that this product works exactly as stated. What more could you ask for.",0
"AutoCAD is the industry standard in drafting programs and the ""LT 2011"" version is a good choice for those who will not need to work in 3D. While my background is a little weak in this area, my Engineering Major nephew was kind enough to give me some help coming up to speed with this excellent program since he used it both in school and at his intern position, which greatly reduced the learning curve! Here are my observations:

Installation: We loaded this on a fairly powerful Compaq laptop running Windows 7 and had no issues. This was very easy to install and each step of installation had a help tab that led you to the online help center if you had any questions

Intuitiveness of controls: This program makes it very easy to get started with 2D applications and the many useful features and tools are well though out. After learning the basics, it became obvious that there might actually be too many tools (more than are likely to be ever used for my needs)

Tutorials: Includes 3 short video demos that are very basic but help you get your bearings, which I highly recommend novice users take the time to watch

In program help tool: While a nice option to have, they can often be somewhat less than useful if you don't already understand the basics

Online help center: The real gem of the ""Help"" options comes from the Online Help Center! It is very helpful with many of the more difficult topics covered, has video aids, and is overall very comprehensive

Honestly this is likely more program than I really need for our small business designing and making molds, but it more than covers what I want it to do. It is very specifically streamlined for making blueprints but is likely useful for many other similar applications.

Highly Recommended! I also bought and recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-AutoCAD-2011-and-AutoCAD-LT-2011/dp/0470621974/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering AutoCAD 2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011</a>&nbsp;to help learn the program when an Engineering student is not readily available.

"I guess this review is kind of late considering April 15 is two days away but better late than never.  This is the 5th or 6th year in a row I have used TaxCut and like the previous years, I am quite pleased.

Since I used it in the prior year, all of the information I entered was carried forward to the current year to use by the software.  That makes it a lot easier.

I don't have a real complicated return.  I do itemize deductions but the most complex thing I deal with are gains and losses on sales of stocks. Even so, I HATE filling out IRS and state tax forms and HATE EVEN MORE the stupid instructions that come with them that only an idiot could have written.  So I am happy to fork over the money for TaxCut and let their much easier question interface lead me through the process, as well as let them determine if I am subject to alternative minimum tax and all these other things thrown in by slimy politicians with ulterior motives.

Several reviewers have complained about the price increase for the 2007 version and I have to agree, I am not happy either.  But considering what you pay to have someone prepare your taxes, it is still pretty reasonable. And I also find it is well worth it to let the program do my taxes instead of pulling out my hair and screaming as I try to make my way through the maze of forms and instructions that comes from the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.

To sum up: I have never had a problem with TaxCut.  The process is very clear, there is a clean data trail that you can print out, and all of the forms print out very cleanly on my printer. I intend to purchase the 2008 program next year unless we have some serious tax reform.. so in other words, I will be buying the 2008 version next year and probably each year's version thereafter.",0

"I used to have an earlier version of this software that, if I remember correctly, was free. It was on my old computer and when that computer died I lost the software along with it. I remembered liking the software, so I was happy to be able to try it again in this newer version.

I have tried several types of video editing software and, to be honest, some of them are very difficult for this old lady to figure out. Pinnacle makes things much easier and is more user-friendly. I've watched tutorials and just played around with it and think this is going to work for me. Maybe I'll even be able to start doing video reviews now.

I received the Pinnacle Plus edition. There is also an Ultimate Edition which has more options and if you're heavy into video editing software you might want to spring for a few bucks more and get the Ultimate edition. For me, the Plus edition is more than enough and I am very happy to have this software again. I installed on a computer that is still running windows 7 and it installed and is working fine for me. Very happy with this new version of software that I had lost when my old computer died.",0
"""Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus"", from Corel Corp., downloaded to my 64bit PC without incident. The program started up quickly and has an intuitive, and familiar, appearance; hovering over most button choices causes an explanatory pop-up. The ""Help"" menu  provides a downloadable 'User Manual' and 'Sample Movie' in addition to links for updates, forums, and support. For the purpose of this review I emailed for support and was surprised at the very quick, and helpful, response.

Although very familiar with a variety of sophisticated photography programs I'm a novice at video creation and 'Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus' is the only program I've had the opportunity to try. I found the 'User Manual' explicit, easy to read and understand, and enormously helpful. There's also an included 45 day access pass to Pinnacle's 'Studio Backlot' where you'll find a host of tutorials. And there are also tutorials available on 'YouTube'.

I've found this program easy to use as it employs familiar actions like drag and drop, but, it also has a learning curve that requires a bit of time and practice to acquire proficiency. After using Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus, off and on, for a few weeks I'm no where near the professional I'd like to be. However, I am confident I'll get there.",0

"This review is on upgrading from Quicken 2013 to 2014. I'm long time Quicken user and update annually. My large (>120MB) data file (>250,000 items and transactions going back to 1995) converted without any problems and my financial institution connections worked as they did before.  There is currently a R2 update patch available.

Didn't notice many visible UI or large feature changes from 2013.  Some of the dialog boxes (such as the One Step Update) are different.  However I did notice very good UI performance improvements in scrolling in the Portfolio View with investments (eg mutual funds) that contain many (100+) transactions.  Scrolling was painfully slow previously.  I understand Quicken 2014 uses an updated .NET software framework improves refresh performance.  I would recommend updating from 2013 to 2014.

Quicken gets a lots negative reviews.  Some of this is likely deserving - releasing 12 patches for Quicken 2013 in a year does not instill quality software development and testing practices.  Some of this is related to the very large user base with varying degrees of computer knowledge, condition of the user computers, and connectivity to a myriad of financial institutions, which Quicken gets the blame for the  problems.

My experience in using Quicken is not representative as portrayed by the severity of the negative product reviews and their support personnel.  I use Quicken extensively for my personal finances, tracking expenses, electronic bill pay via Quicken BillPay, and investments, making use of its online capabilities to send/update transactions, that I couldn't do without it. (My most used application after Office, browser, and email client.)  The Quicken community forum is pretty active and helpful in resolving problems.  I have had Quicken hang-up, crash, but I have not lost data, nor have erroneous balances or mishaps in any electronic payments.

With the shift to cloud-computing and mobile devices, there are a number of alternatives to Quicken like mint.com (also owned by Quicken's parent company, Intuit), or financial institution online services.  Some of these alternatives may be suitable to you depending on your needs.  I have not found any alternatives which provide the personal finance management capabilities as Quicken.

I hope Intuit management is paying serious attention to the negative publicity and addressing these issues as I would like see Intuit continue to have the revenue stream to be able to invest in developing and enhancing the product.

**11/21/2013 Update: Have used Quicken 2014 now for two months.  (System:  Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on a laptop with a 3rd generation i7 processor, 8GB RAM.  I keep my O/S and drivers updated to the latest releases.)  A R3 patch for Quicken 2014 is available.  In reading many of the amazon reviews, it's hard for me to imagine that I am using the same software.  My overall experience with Quicken 2014 has been positive. It has worked like Quicken 2013 with some performance improvements and generally stable/faster downloads (several financial institutions and many securities quotes).  I only experienced one crash and it was during a R3 patch installation.  No data loss due to crash.  I don't use the mobile feature (due to the reviews and no support for investments) or Windows 8 - which appears to be the root of some of the reported problems.  Quicken 2014 billing/reminder feature is useful.  It addresses the transaction copy/paste I used to perform to create a future income/expense view in an account register.  One issue I noticed is that you cannot switch applications when running the One Step update.  In other words you can't let the One Step update run in the background and work in another application.  Quicken returns the focus to itself.  Reading the Quicken forum, this is a known issue and hopefully will be addressed in near future. Also enabled mouse pointer trails which improved transaction entry speed.**

**12/4/2013 Update:  R4 patch appears to have fixed the ability to switch applications during One Step update.**

**2/14/2014 Update:  R6 patch was released in February.**

**3/12/2014 Update:  R7 patch released.**",0

"I'm not hugely experienced using Roxio Creator.  I've almost always had one version or another of Roxio Creator, and find that I mostly use it for converting my cd's to different audio formats for use on different devices, or for making fun cd's for the car of favorites.

I also tend to use it when making data cds as I can't find the software my laptop came with for doing that.  I can find this one every time and it is pretty easy to use.

As for use, it is fairly easy to use - you select what you want to do, then follow the steps.  I like that Roxio has made it so easy this way.

I didn't realize I could convert video specifically for my Kindle Fire, but Roxio makes that possible too - that is on my to-do list, but I haven't tested that section yet.

"Roxio Creator has been around for a long time. I've gone through at least 4 other versions and have nothing but praise for the product. It works and works well. Every version adds new features and this version, Creator NXT is no exception.

Usually I upgrade my Roxio software when I upgrade Windows and I need the newer version of Roxio to work with the new versions of Windows. I upgraded this time after going to Windows 8.  This doesn't surprise me as CD/DVD software hooks into the storage code of the operating system to do its thing. Change that code (as in a Windows upgrade) and Roxio needs to be updated. In the past, I only cared about the DVD/CD writing capabilities of Roxio. But after seeing the new software included with NXT, I find I'm really using the new programs. These new programs are Videowave (video editing), Convert (captures and converts videos to different formats), Paintshop Pro (photo editing), and Audio capture and conversion. Most of the time, you access these programs from the Roxio menu screen by selecting what you want to do and the menu launches the program you need to do the task.

Some of the new features that I find the most useful include:

Converting video to the best format to transfer to your tablet, phone, or share online.
Capture videos from websites (like Youtube).
Making slideshows from photos (including adding soundtracks) then converting to video format.
Convert audio formats (great for converting your CDs to MP3s for your iPod/iPhone.
Make a DVD with multiple movies and menus for accessing them.

These are just a few of the many features available (not enough space to list them all here).  All these features are only great if they work well. And they do. I haven't really mentioned the main reason for this software to exist.. and that is to burn CDs and DVDs. As I mentioned, Roxio Creator has been around for a while. It started out being just a CD burning program and it always has done that well.

"I found Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate a very usable video editing program for my modest needs. It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

Hope this helps someone.",0

"Corel VideoStudio PRO X8 is designed as an easy to use, basic video editor for Windows 8 and 7 on PCs.  It works very similar to other basic to mid level video editing programs that exist today.  In general, you select the clips you want to use in your movie and then drag and drop them into the timeline in the order you want them shown. As desired, you can move clips around, arranging them into different sequences. If instead of movies, you want to produce slide shows of photos, the VideoStudio X8 can do that as well.

The software comes with a lot of different effects and transitions as well as a number of music samples that you can use to produce a decent video easily.  In general, the program is responsive but it does seem slow when it is rendering the final video.

"I've been using it for the last 1 year and enjoyed this antenna.
Thanks to this antenna, my wi-fi internet is available in the entire house + children's playground, which was NOT the case with my router's original antenna. In addition, I must note that unlike other brands, TrendNet is cheaper and offers compatible quality. In short - highly recommended.",0
"This is a great little switch. I replaced a big 24 port gig switch with this to save some money on power and to reduce the amount of heat generated by my network gear in my home office. It runs cool and is part of their new ""green"" switch line that reduces power consumption in a number of ways. It does everything I expect higher end web-managed switches to do, and is extremely affordable. I like that 3Com has redesigned this line to have flat case tops instead of the rounded tops they used to have (no more need for the extra bracket in order to put something on top of it). Make sure that you upgrade the firmware on this switch right out of the box before doing ANYTHING else; there's a bug in the shipped firmware that will brick the switch when you set the password and you'll have to console into it to recover otherwise. The new firmware fixes that.",0

"I have used several paint programs including the Corel Painter X3 which is intended for more serious and professional applications. The Corel Painter Essentials 5 provides a set of nice features for general photos touch-up and artwork painting. I like its simple user friendly interface which requires very little learning to use. The program also works nicely with my Wacom tablet.

On top of its standard painting tools, the program also has an auto-paint feature which automatically enhance our photos with various styles and effects. I found this feature pretty fun to use for adding artistic effects to the photos.

If you are looking for a good painting software for general photos touch-up and effects, these would be a good one to consider.",0
"I am not a professional videographer or anything, but I like to be able to record gymnastics, dance recitals, etc. and then be able to crop, zoom, add titles, and so on before burning them off to DVDs to send to the grandparents.  I had been doing this using various free software (e.g., Windows Movie Maker to edit, DVD burning to burn, etc.) and thought I would give this a try.

This is absolutely a better tool for the job.  I was able to figure out how to use it without hitting the Help feature once (which will get you up to three stars all by itself!).  A beginner should have no problem editing and making movies in no time.  Everything that I need is all in one product and in reality, it has far more features than I need, but now that I have them, I will figure out a way to put them to use.

Definitely recommend for the home enthusiast.",0

"I was tired of trying different products that did different things and often competed with each other when I asked my sis-in-law what products she recommended to protect her computers, manage backups and secure her identity. She has worked with computers for decades and proudly holds the title of Family Geek to this day. She gifted me with my first license for Norton 360 about 2008 and I have resubscribed ever since.

The most important stuff that Norton 360 does is rarely noticeable. Every once in awhile, while surfing, I will get a heads up about a website known for malicious activity or told that a file I tried to download is corrupt. N360 runs regular scans to check for viruses and infections or to let me know when it is time to take some additional action to tune up for performance. My favorite and most used feature is the Identity Safe, which does exactly what Norton says: ""remembers, secures, and automatically enters your usernames and passwords for you, so they can't be lost or stolen.""

One trick that I learned (that at least one other person here has shared) is do not set up your account to automatically renew. I have a Google alert set up to let me know when Amazon and other retailers have it on sale. I have easily saved as much as 75% compared to what Norton would have charged me to auto-renew. You can even buy a couple at a time because the key codes stack.

"I have been making home videos for years. I used VideoStudio 7, 9, X1, X2 plus, X3 Plus, X4,X5 and now the latest X6. I also tried digital video softwares from Pinnacle, Roxio, Adobe Premiere. However, Corel software beats them for stability and easy of use. The Adobe Premiere is a great software, but it's overwhelming and overkill for most of us. In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other softwares.

From product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn. The basic functions are easy to use and intuitive. You use the timeline to place video clips, then add transitions, background music, titles. After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.

By the way, editing HD videos requires a very powerful PC system, this is especially true if you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you see frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to mouse clicking, video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.

Here is one trick I learned from professional Video Magazine. While running the VideoStudio with you main hard drive (like C-drive), you should put all video files (both the video input files and video output files) in a separate hard drive. Doing so can ensure a better system performance. With my system, if I put all the video files in the C-drive where the main program resides, from time to time, the VideoStudio program will still hang (not response to your mouse) for couple of second (not crash). This hanging problem goes away once I put videos files at a separate hard drive (not the C-drive).

So far, I have done couple home videos and created some AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X6. Especially the newly added subtitling support.

Though I have long experience with VideoStudio, I would definitely recommend this software to beginners. It comes with so many pre-packaged automated processes that beginners can use them easily.",0
We were struggling with how to share a limited resource that needed to be tested by several developers.  The test resource was off in a room far away from me and upstairs from another developer.  Loading our tests onto laptops was a pain.  With Anywhere USB we can all share.  We all run Messenger to chat to coordinate access.  It even works over our wireless lan.  I have used Digi products for years.  As always they just work without any fuss.  Configuration was mostly easy.  It takes a few minutes to load all the drivers.

"This is a tried and tested product of Peachtree - now renamed as Sage. I love the fact that it has easy installation and the ever so helpful wizards that in within the product. Not only that, they also have provide a contact service to call in case we need further assistance with the product.

I can look at it and tell what is the revenue the company is making, the vendors information - billing and collection etc. The best part, I can modify it to suit my needs and see which information needs my attention the most at the current moment. It even comes with Analysis tools which is useful for projections of the company in the short-mid term assessments.

"If ths following is your idea of good product support, then by all means, purchase Turbo Tax.  While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.

The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.

The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, ""You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843.""",1
"The Crime: A -

Bess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch. Now a phantom horse is appearing at night, heralding major accidents. Just before Nancy arrives, for example, Bess's uncle is bit by a rattlesnake and rushed to the hospital. What's going on here?

Suspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.

Fun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.

By this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.

The story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though. Plus there are horses. Horses count for a lot in my book.

Puzzles: A -

Puzzles included everything from baking a cake to solving a little metal maze. The maze drove me insane.

One puzzle in particular made me roll my eyes because the way you find the solution is utterly dumb. You're looking for a really old piece of information, and Bess and George, stuck at the airport, happen to find a book that contains exactly what you need to know. And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.

Gameplay: A +

The new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access. I thought the wide screen was great but the extra clicking irritated me, because if you may miss the little button to close it or change pages. You get used to it, though.

Western life comes alive at Shadow Ranch, where you repair the chicken coop, perform daily tasks and always take care of your horse when you get back to the stable or Tex will have something to say to you!

Other fun in the game includes invesitgating a ghost town, learning to use a lariat (lasso) and completing a barrel race in under ten seconds.

You know how I said that DDI has everything but romance? Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.

Time Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.

Voice Acting: A

Raspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend. Many of the voice actors hear have appeared in other games, so it's a treat for a long-time fan. Superlative delivery, as always.

Favorites -

Music: A +

IGraphics/Video: A +

No problems, just peachy.

I have been using Quicken 2011 as a beta tester for the last 2 months during the beta test period. This new version is considerably faster in saving and operations. The new Spending screens are very helpful. It is much easier to identify and fix the un-categorized transaction as well. I also use this version to track my car maintenance and repairs in a separate account and my medical expenditures complete with scanned copies of receipts in my main account file. This may seem unusual but with the enhanced search functions and reporting flexibility in Quicken I can retrieve these records very easily.,0
"After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 3 years ago instead. I've been happy with the software every year since then. The first year I did the online download through Amazon and it went quickly. Installation was straightforward as it is with the actual disc. In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out. Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward. I'll be using H&R Block from now on. H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax if you decide to switch over.",0

"I've always thought Nero was more geared toward the tech geek than the casual/novice user.  They're moving more towards also helping the novice, but in this release and updates available for it, it supports burning AVCHD video to DVD.  This is the format my digital video camera produces in HD, and very few applications were supporting it when I purchased this program.

I've never had it hang or crash on me.  The only draback is that it likes to take over displaying every image, quick time, windows media and other file types if you let it.  Just don't let it.

Otherwise, burning CD's and DVD's is simple and easy with Nero.  Upgrades and updates always keep you on top of new stuff. Often, the updates are free.",0

"I refused to use a walkthrough for this game. Absolutely refused. And players, I promise you don't need one. You just really have to put your noggins to work. Which I can understand why some people don't like that (who loves thinking? pah! -- I kid, I promise). I just really (REALLY) enjoy brain teasers and puzzles. I always have. My mother got me two huge books full of puzzles as a kid and I finished them within a month. That being said, if you like your games more straight forward, you probably won't enjoy this game as much. But that's ok too, there's a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.

My one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.

But really, they're minor complaints. This game is rich in history, both fictional and some real, the spooky air is well maintained, and the mystery goes perfectly with the adventure. I felt a bit intrusive on the family, but that's a good thing. It makes Nancy as a character stronger. She is nosy to a fault. And I thank the creator for that because that creates amazing games.

If you're ready to take a challenge and be scared a bit, then you're ready for this game. But if you're looking for something a bit easier to complete, I suggest picking up Treasure in a Royal Tower instead. It isn't scary by any means, but other than that it has a lot of the same things this game does. Rich history and a lot of exploring. If you're looking for an easier scary game...well, they haven't actually produced an easy scary game yet (and I don't think Haunted Mansion/Ghost Dogs count as scary, Malloy is a meh game and I don't recommend it to anyone, and Shadow at Water's Edge, while being pretty scary, is also a bit on the hard side).",0

"I continue to be amazed by today's video editors for home use and how good they do the job. This product in addition to all the core video editing features contains a new application called content-aware editing.

Content-aware editing attempts to do the rough initial editing for you automatically by identifying the most interesting scenes as well as scenes that need some editing. It scans and looks for pans, zooms, motion and faces. The scenes with problems are fixed using Cyberlink's TrueTheater technology for example shaky/unstable camera and low lighting correction. Then select your scenes and import them to the timeline for more editing and refinement. This new application has the potential to save users import time and processing time. How useful is this? It could certainly help with initial editing of a long video. Just don't forget the one scene or scenes that you want to include such as a beautiful sunset still shot.

Other highlights include:
64-bit TrueVelocity 3 with faster editing - multi GPGPU support optimizes itself to your computers processing and graphics capabilities. For example multiple graphics (integrated graphics and a graphics card) to speed up editing, rendering and effect processing.

Numerous Input/Output formats supported

Dark interface

Ripple editing

Improved color correction

Redesigned tools for PIP (Picture in picture designer for animating visual elements), particle effects, titles and menus with the ability to see full screen.

"After using VideoStudio for many years, I started looking for another video editing program that is faster and could output 3D Blu-ray. Several months ago, I bought and used PowerDirector 12 and was impressed by how fast it authored and burned 3D Blu-rays.

This version is even faster. I have burned several 3D discs and am amazed at its speed. A short compilation video of a trio of scenes took less than three minutes. A six-minute puppet show took less than eight minutes. I am used to starting the process and then coming back hours later, hoping that everything worked. With this software, I can try multiple options and not be as concerned with time. I generally use BD-RE discs so wasting discs (""creating coasters"") is not an issue.

Editing video is similar to other programs but there is still a slight learning curve. As I learn more about this program (and I had only used PD12 for a few months so not a lot of experience overall), it appears that it will expand to meet my needs. I have downloaded some menus and templates from the Cyberlink website and appreciate the other users' contributions. I tried the EZ video option where the program will attempt to analyze the input files and select the project options. It took quite a while to process the video and the result was similar to what I would choose. Maybe I did not enable some feature but overall I did not find it worthwhile.

For 3D video, I am using a JVC Everio GS-TD1 and it works quite well. I have also tried a Fujifilm W-3 but have not been able to find the proper combination to output a usable disc. It records in 24FPS and there might be some setting I am not choosing correctly. The JVC works pretty much with defaults. 2D video is completely straightforward and I have used multiple sources successfully. All that is required is to choose the proper output path.

As far as resources, I am running this on an i7 PC under 64-bit Windows 7. I did get the BSOD once while editing video with Adobe Lightroom and Internet Explorer running in the background. Reducing resource load while editing is definitely recommended. I have burned usable discs while surfing the net multiple times so that should be OK.",0

"This will be my 6th year of preparing my taxes with Turbo Tax, and from my initial experience with this version it won't be my last.

The software installs cleanly and quickly, with a minimum of fuss.  And the user interface with it's easy to understand interview format couldn't be better.  It's quite the hoot to watch your refund status change as you enter each new piece of information (even if it goes from refund to ""you owe"").  If you need help, there are definitions and help aplenty.  If you're more proficient than me, you can even skip the interview and go directly to the forms.

For me though, the biggest advantage of all comes from the time I save doing my state taxes (please, let's not get into a debate on state income taxes, okay?).  Within 5 minutes of completing my Federal return, the state return is done and I'm ready to get on with life again.",0

"I was very happy with this game- it took the bets parts of the previous Oregon Trail incarnations and wove them together for a good overall product. I can appreciate a company which recognizes both the weaknesses and the strengths of their products and uses this information to get better. In this Oregon Trail you can once again chose how many you will travel with and name them (for some crazy reason this feature was eliminated in the 4th Oregon Trail edition), but you can also CHOOSE the times you stop to collect wild fruit or fish, instead of these circumstances just happening randomly (which does not make as much sense). To me, these were the biggest changes to previous games, but they were improvements.

Aside from the above changes, the basics of the game remain the same, and it will look familiar to those who have played other editions. A few things have been updated, particularly some aspects concerning Native Americans and some geography, but the good times still keep rolling.",0

Using a tablet with the program allows an artist to create really impressive illustrations, drawings, digital paintings and more, quickly and easily.

The program is easy to use, and the learning curve is not steep.  It doesn't take forever to learn where things are and how to produce different effects, and the artist can get right down to creating, instead of trying to learn the program.  Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011 is also  fast to respond, without painful lags or delays that tend to zap the creative juices and cause frustration.

I highly recommend this fun little program to anyone who loves to sketch, draw, paint or design graphics and illustrations digitally.",0
"I have been using McAfee total protection for months now and while at first I thought their performance issues were fixed, eventually the PC scans start slowing the PC and affecting performance in general. When I was given the choice to try Norton 360, which I had already used before but did not renew when it expired, I didn't think it twice.

First of all, installation was fast and without any issues, unlike McAfee which asks you to download and install a bunch of stuff you would assume is already in the disc. Norton's interface is very easy to use, and is being continually improved. It is a simple task to find what you need and start whatever action you want to, without having to rely on help menus and the like.

The tools included are the following: Antivirus, Antispyware, Identity Protection, Password Vault (for both Internet Explorer and Firefox), PC Tune-up (Which does a great job in boosting performance)  and Backup (very basic but it's there should you need it)

If I had to mention the one thing I like the most from Norton 360 that would be performance. It does not feel like you have it installed! Scans in the background do not feel at all, I know Norton is scanning items only because a pop up lets me know when done. And that is another thing, pop-ups appear only when needed (some can be disabled if you want) and they are not as annoying as other products out there.

Surfing the web is great with Norton 360, the password vault is a great thing to use if you do shopping and use personal information and credit cards (Firefox offers a similar feature but without the protection Norton offers) Additionally, if you do a Google search for example, Norton 360 will scan the websites listed and let you know which are safe and which are not before actually clicking on the link. If this is not enough, Norton offers a functionality in which you can type the web address you intend to visit and will run a complete scan and even give you reviews of the website from other users before actually accessing it! I ran a couple tests and I can confirm results are reliable (P2P websites and the like are recognized as potential threats by Norton)

Overall, a great tool and certainly the best from the ones I have tried, and for the price, you get protection for up to three PCs. Definitely recommend it over McAfee.",0
"We've used Norton products for years and years, and have also used other products on other machines we use. Norton's always been reliable for us. We were last using Norton 360 on the machine we installed this on. Installation of 2014 was easy, it was up and running quickly, and we haven't had any problems with the machine since then.

It has cool performance charts that keep track of programs being installed and what your CPU usage was, so that's handy to look at.

We tend to be careful about the sites we visit, so we are probably less exposed to potential virusses than, say, a teenager with a penchant for downloading thousands of illegal files. Still, it's always wise to be protected, and this is doing its job well.",0

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 version were resolved in this X4 version.  It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 A very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace.  You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software.  This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices.  If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5.  Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own.  As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.  I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.

The PaintShop Pro X4 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down.  With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10.  PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.  The rich set of tools included in PaintShop Pro range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the new ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.  This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects.  Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.  To help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.  One thing that I noticed was that the dialog box window for the 'Effect Browser' has not been updated to match the stylish new user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PaintShop Pro versions.

 The new HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools.  HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure.  There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing.  For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing.  On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating.  Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix.  In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at.  If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results.  But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots.  Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene.  This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output.  I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people.  HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at.  Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described.  So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo.  This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well.  As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.  When I mentioned above that Photomatix lets me specifically define and select the original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for people's faces, I can simulate this function in PaintShop Pro by using this new ""Photo Blend"" tool on the saved file output after using the ""Exposure Merge"" tool, but this workflow is very cumbersome and tedious.

 The new ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas.  This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 Although adding a vignette effect was present in previous PaintShop Pro versions, this has now been expanded into a separate tool with more flexible options.

 A new ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo.  These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 More than 20 tools have been upgraded to support 16-bit images.

 There is built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"".  The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos.  This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files.  Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos.  The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools.  Edits can also be applied to batches of files.  This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab.  Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work.  By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab.  I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools.  If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab.  The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top.  Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools.  And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'.  The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab.  One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool.  But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'.  Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are.  At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option.  Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials.  As with some of their other recent software releases, Corel has the help documentation in this PaintShop Pro X4 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched.  I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site.  After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access.  On September 2011, Corel released a 125-MB 'Corel_PSPX4_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on my computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new tab to display Corel's online help content.  And there does not seem to be a way to configure PaintShop Pro X4 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available.  But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed.  The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If, like me, your PaintShop pro install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files.  This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability.  During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook.  Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer.  When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This new X4 version of PaintShop Pro now requires only 1GB of disk space.  The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized.  So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required.  By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 10, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program!

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of.  If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free.  And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance.  In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.  But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go.  Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative.  If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4.  And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a previous version of PaintShop Pro, is this PaintShop Pro X4 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely!  As previously mentioned, if version X4's one main new feature was the addition of HDR tools, I would say to just keep your existing X3 version and purchase Photomatix for your HDR needs since Photomatix is far better at HDR processing than what Corel, or Adobe, has as their HDR offering.  But there are at least 75 new and enhanced features with version X4, and if you can purchase it aggressively discounted on Amazon, this is a must-buy upgrade.  Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 runs a lot faster and more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PaintShop Pro X4 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>?

I feel that PaintShop Pro X4 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 10.  PSPX4 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE10.  APE10 includes more built-in layer styles that PSPX4 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this.  Once you become proficient in PSPX4, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse.  Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PaintShop Pro, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem.  APE10 has more adjustment brushes than PSPX4 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation.  But PSPX4 has more artistic tools than APE10, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSPX4 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE10.  PSPX4 requires less than half the disk space to install than APE10, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE10, even though PSPX4 is far more packed with features.  But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE10 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSPX4.

One final note:

Two of the extras that are included in this ""Ultimate"" bundle are couple codes that allow you to download 21 photos from Fotolia and receive a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  However, these coupon codes have expiration dates on them, and on the package that I received, the offers are only valid through December 31 2012.  I do not know if this expiration date applies to the coupon codes of all ""Ultimate"" packages that are shipped throughout 2012 or if Corel adjusts the expiration dates for packages that are shipped out later, but that is something to consider if you are deciding to purchase this near the end of 2012.

Also, during the past 8 months, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for this PaintShop Pro X4.  After installing PaintShop Pro on your computer, you can either download these large 235-MB executables from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",0

"As a professional photographer I have a reputation for having a creative eye. Likewise as a graphic artist I can communicate compelling thoughts and concepts through visual media relatively effortlessly. But I know my limits - I am not a sketch artist nor a painter. Put a brush in my hand and never in a million years will I come up with the Mona Lisa. My sketching skills tend toward mechanical drawing ... linking a series of boxes and circles and lines which I do daily when I am trying to conceptualize a project. So imagine my surprise when I opened this software app called SketchBook and without reading a words of instructions the first thing I did is drew a cat's face, with a very coy Disney cartoon look on her face. I'm excited about the possibilities that a $60 app can bring to my creative toolbox. On that basis I recommend SketchBook to anyone who already has a creative knack or a wants to develop their skills to express themselves visually. The startup learning curve is nowhere near as daunting as other apps I've previously tried but the creative possibilities seem to fairly endless.

I strongly recommend that you read V.Hutson's review of this product and watch her excellent video. It is in my opinion the definitive Amazon review of this product, coupled with an excellent video. It is helpful to get the opinion about a product like this from someone who has artistic skills, it helps people like me who are still developing their sketching abilities.

There was a little glitch in which the needed serial number was not included with the installation disk. Amazon quickly discovered the error and sent an email out with the proper serial number shortly thereafter. Not including the serial number with the DVD was probably a simple oversight and should not reflect on the merits of the software and certainly should not drag it down to 1-star for a minor inconvenience.

Bottom line: this software is cheap enough to buy and is easily worth the price. Creativity is a very personal thing and it is hard to put a finger on whether this particular app is best for you. As I often say about camera equipment, it's not the camera that creates a great photograph it is the photographer. So with this app, and some practice on your part, it might be the right tool to give you the results you want.",0

"Please be aware that the vast majority of the reviews for this product are false and probably written by employees of the competing product. Ok enough of that, lets get to this product.

We use this for our business and sofar have been very happy with this product. Sure there are some times the program offers services that are not included and probably should have been. It is very easy to use and a complete solution for our company. The other competing products are more aggressive with offering paid for addons. Sage 50 is more matter of fact when they offer them so its a bit more palatable. Our accountant loves this program because he uses it every day. I use it to check the reports he generates. We can import CSV files into the program fairly easily and this allows for faster integration of our data.

Pros:
+ Easy to use
+ Easy to install
+ Import data easily
+ Nice looking reports
+ Mostly complete

Cons:
- Payroll addon (come on shouldnt these be included???)
- Other addons that should also be included for the price.

Overall we will continue to use this software. The other alternative is just not worth the hassle and aggressive tactics.

Thanks for reading my review.",0

"I have used TurboTax for years and years and it has served me well. I am self-employed and this Home and Business version is excellent for that. I am on a Macintosh computer, but several of my friends also use the Home & Business as well.",0
Downloaded and installed on a customers computer in less than 45 Minutes. I like the downloading capability when you need software fast.,0
"I'm very pleased with the size and quality of the product.  It's tiny, with just enough of the unit exposed so that it can be easily grasped and removed.  It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

I'm really glad that I bought it based both on the performance & the fact that it was a third of the cost of similar items sold in local stores.",0
Works well,0
"Small, completely portable, inexpensive, and, best of all, WORKS GREAT and BETTER than expected!  I'm using this in my RV to take advantage of the public WiFi.  So glad I bought this & now I can watch streaming videos and music on YouTube, CNN.com, & other websites whereas before I could not get a strong enough signal.",0
"This is a terrific little set of applications.  If it had only been GarageBand it would have been worth the modest cost.  GarageBand is a sturdy, multispectrum, easy to use multi track recording studio.  Its predecessor was pretty basic - but the new version is a substantial update.  The user interface is simpler and more straight forward.  I can now utilize all of the outputs on my mixer (earlier versions limited me to a few at a time).  The loop record function allows me to overdub again and again as I practice a riff - the stacked riffs can be isolated, and cut/pasted into the final mix with remarkable ease.  There is a basic but formidable set of effects, including a very passable compressor, a great limiter to maximize volume without sacrificing quality, almost unlimited mixing capabilities.
But its not just GarageBand - the new iPhoto is a tremendous improvement as well.  I've seen some critical reviews stating that having the library available only within the application is a hassle.  Its actually not.  Its easy enough to sidestep this in any of several ways - import the photos to a separate file before adding them to the iPhoto library - you can then import them into iPhoto from their folders, but here's the benefit! If the drive you import the files to is different from the one you have the iPhoto library on, well then you have just created a backup for the photos.  Its always a good idea too to burn a CD or DVD with those images in case of a system or hardware crash!  I love the new ""events"" feature.  It is so easy to keep track of images now - being able to preview all the images in an event without opening its library is a great time saver.  And I love the interactivity with the internet - I've posted a few web galleries directly from iPhoto - they look great and so far everyone I've invited to look has been impressed both with how easily the galleries work and how stable and fast the are.
iMovie works wonderfully - although I've upgraded and purchased Final Cut Express 8 - iMovie is great for rough cuts, but FCE offers much more diverse tools for polishing!
iWeb is a limited but functional website builder - it lacks the diversity and flexibility of GoLive or Dreamweaver, but then I don't always have the time or the energy to use those applications for very basic informational webbing.
And finally, iDVD does exactly what its supposed to.
I think that is the critical point about all the Apple applications I own - FinalCut Express, Logic Express, iLife and iWork, OSX Leopard.  They do exactly what they advertise, and do it well.  If you have an Apple machine that meets the hardware standards (read that last line again!) then you can't go wrong with these applications!  Once you've bought iLife, make sure to watch the short but helpful training videos on the Apple website.  It will jumpstart your usage!",0
"This version of Office is a pleasant step up from the 2003 I've been using. Excel was  little quirky in that it crashed a lot until I made a couple tweaks I read about in the Office Community pages. However, I'm upgrading to 2013 this week simply because the mainstream support of 2007 is expiring this fall (Oct 2017).  It was typically easy to install and it allowed me to keep my Office 2003 version without any problems. Converting my old jspreadsheets to the 2007 format was easy but I strongly recommend saving any Excel sheets in the 2007 format xlsm (macro enabled) because until I did that all my docs would freeze up and Excel just crashed every time I opened a doc. I gave Word a quick test drive and it seems fine. I really really like the easy of inserting tables.  I've yet to try Word out on any of my larger docs (700 page novel, for example) but I don't foresee any troubles. Overall, I like it but I still am upgrading.",0

"As ever the Norton security it great.  The best thing about it that it runs quietly in the background and does not slow down you computer. It is very easy to install if you have an account with them.  I only need it for two devices so having to buy it for 5 is not very fair, but as far as I know it is not overly expensive if I only use it on 2.",0
Worth all four of the software programs which are included in this product.,1
"....Core Duo with 2GB of ram I can run Windows Vista. I am having to allocate 1 GB of ram to get reasonable performance. I do not dedicate both ""cores"" to VM Fusion, but I will caution you that performance on the Mac side will be sluggish on a machine like this while running VMWare.

But, let's think about this. I have a machine that was the cheapest mac sold about 4 years ago. I installed and set up Windows Vista without a single hitch. Everything works out of the box. Consider the complaints you hear about Vista (fair or not). I am running it fine, no problems at all.

The applications I am running are fairly simple. No Solidworks or other 3D software. No games. Just IE, Microsoft office, Camtasia and a few other things. It fills in the gaps for things I need to test out, not owning a ""real PC"".

Should you get this? Do you need to run windows apps with no fuss, and decent performance? Don't want to deal with setting up boot camp, and want both your Mac and ""PC"" available at the same time? Would like like to share folders between machines, and generally not have to mess around with a real PC? How about this -- be able to run pre-made computer OS images so that you can try out stuff like Ubuntu or Drupal without have to install anything? I wanted to test OLPC's Sugar interface, so I found a prebuilt image for VMWare and just ran it -- bingo -- I have a OLCP test machine for web content.

This is well worth owning if you answered yes to any of the questions above.",0

"Installed this product with no hassles, I bought this item on sale and it has not dissapointed.

Just a word of warning, though;  you can't plug these into a surge protector (including any surge protector inside a power strip.)",0
"So far so good, I've been running SecureAnywhere AntiVirus 3 for a little over a month now.

"I have found this to be a wonderful and fun program.  There are a wide variety of paint brushes, pastels, and pencil effects to choose from in the painting area.  The results are largely accurate with rich brush stroke textures and even bleeding on brushes that would do the same in real life.  There are also a number of erasing effects available.  You can free paint, draw straight lines, and resize your brush.  There is a mixing pallet for mixing just the right color to suit your tastes.

The photo painting area is fantastic with incredibly simple auto painting features and a wide array of custom settings to choose from to get just the look you are interested in.  You can doge details back in wherever you like for exactly the look you want without losing important details.

Another fantastic thing about this program is the ability to work in layers.  It is also compatible with tablets.  The software comes with very helpful tutorials to help you get rich, lovely results.",0

"Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.

Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview

I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.

In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.

Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.

The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.",1

"The overall style is fill in the blanks in a progressive manner. It is divided up into five general sections:

Will
Health Care Directive (Living Will & Power of Attorney
Durable Power of Attorney for Finances
Final Arrangements
Information for Caregivers and Survivors

At the end of the first section (Will), it offers to do a search for local attorneys to review your will. I live near Houston and there was only one estate planning attorney on their list. It asks you to fill out a few basic questions and asks for the size of the estate. And then it emails your request for review to the attorney.  I haven't gotten past this step. I can probably expect to be requested to make an appointment with the attorney for some unknown cost.

This fill in the blanks style of generating a will seems too simple. I seriously doubt that it is sufficient to hold up in court. So even though this software is inexpensive, I think the greater cost will be follow-up with an estate attorney of their choosing. I'm sure Nolo gets a kick-back referral fee from the attorney they recommend.

My personal opinion is that the will should be coupled with a prenuptial agreement or a post nuptial agreement for best overall protection. That is my plan for the time being.

You have to start somewhere and this software is certainly a great way to make you think of most possibilities and general situations. If you have a very complex estate and family, you probably need an estate lawyer.",0
"Look, I could write a review that tries to coddle those who are having a problem with this McAfee Virus Scan program, but for me, it is like finally arriving after a sea of disappointments. (I am talking about McAfee VirusScan Plus 2008-3 User Newest Version) Make sure you remove all other antivirus programs, and firewalls first before loading this McAfee Virus application. I have never seen an antivirus program that works properly with a 2nd antivirus program loaded at the same time.
It includes a Security Center, Virus Scan, Personal Firewall, Easy Network, and Site Advisor.

First of all forgive me for writing such a long review, but there is a lot of ground to cover. For those who like the short version, with less information here it is: Norton slowed my DSL connection down by a third. I spent a day with Verizon, couldn't figure out why all of my other machines in the network were getting 756k, and this one got only 4 or 500 tops. Then I removed Norton, and bingo, instant 756k. AVG free edition is nice but takes a lot of boot up time while it updates upon every single boot up, unless you disable that feature, then it sends out your Outlook email with a message that your antivirus is out of date, and this email could be dangerous, or something like that. Zone Alarm used to be the best, now they are nearing the worst. My Windows 2000 machine went blue screen after an update, took me 2 days to figure out that was the problem, so I removed it after discovering the problem in a forum, and it solved it. Also ZA after recommending it to my friend, would not work at all in a Windows XP Media Center machine. Ask ZA and they say they no longer support it in Media Center. 50 bucks down the drain. Now it takes my XP regular edition SP2 well over 5 minutes to boot with Zone Alarm Security Suite, and I mean WELL over 5 minutes; it's ridiculous. I removed it to load this McAfee Virus Scan (MVS), and the machine immediately booted in only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to the point I was able to bring a Google page up. So I loaded this MVS and the machine booted in only 2 minutes and 45 seconds, once again to a Google page appearing. In both cases I clicked on a Google desktop icon as soon as it appeared, and then waited for the results. It clicks, goes dark blue, and waits for everything else to load, including MVS before it will allow a page to appear. So MVS took only 30 additional seconds to load, and according to Scotty the watchdog in WinPatrol, it loads about 7 .exe files. So that is fast. Now that is with a machine that is loaded up with a ton of programs.

I first loaded MVS in my home office machine, in the same network, with the same configuration, Asus A8N SLI, AMD 64 3200+, 1Gb ram. The home office machine with MVS loaded, gave me the same results but in approximately one minute before I could get a Google page up. (This is an edit, I actually timed the boot up, and not counting the time to type in my password, it booted in exactly 42 seconds) Boot up to Google in only a minute with MVS, and in 2 minutes and 45 seconds in my overloaded machine that used to take well over 5 minutes with Zone Alarm. I'm sold.

While performing a scan it did not affect the performance of the machine, either in surfing the web, or opening programs, even the intensive programs like Dreamweaver MX 2004, or Photoshop CS2.

When loading do as the quick start guide says, put in the CD, then choose the option of loading from the web. It's a 45 Meg download, but it's the latest.

Manage network feature, it recognized all of the other machines, and components with an IP address in my network. It recognized my Windows Server 2003 R2 Edition, but gave me a status message of a request to upgrade to an operating system of at least W2000 or later. I guess that is because of W2003 security, blocking scans.

Before I even acquired MVS I did not understand exactly what they meant by the 3 user allowance, and couldn't find anything on it, so I want to share that with you. Did they mean that you could load it on one machine sharing a network, and then scan individual drives across the network, the same way early ZA did, or does this mean you can put it in more than one machine for full protection at all times. Fortunately it means the latter. I loaded it in the home office machine, registering it in my name to be able to get virus updates, and created a user name and password. Then I went into the other machine, dropped in the CD, did a complete install, but when the registration page came up, I logged in instead, and it instantly completed the registration for me, reminding me of my user name and password, and congratulating me on the installation. So it is a 3 machine complete install, that is cool, or should I say way cool.

I know this isn't about MVS but I advise you to get a free copy of CCleaner from the web. (Google it.) It cleans all the junk out of your computer and you can run it quickly before entering sensitive password sites for example. It cleans out your cache, cookies, etc. in only a few seconds. When you run it for the first time, it will take several minutes to remove it all, for example a ton of web pages you have been surfing, that your machine checks first, before drawing it from the distant server. A slooooow way for your machine to have to work.

McAfee has been around for a zillion years, they have been a leader, and from the performance of this product so far, they have totally aced it. You can see all of the other antivirus and firewall programs I have tried, and this one according to boot up time, and scan speed is the best. It scanned my office machine quickly, although I did not time it accurately. It scanned several gigs of data in what seemed like 10 minutes. My other machine with 230 Gigs of data takes about 5 hours with Zone Alarm, because I am using their older 7.0 version, it took 3 times that long with their newer version that works with Vista and XP. I am using it on an XP machine. Once again, had to get rid of the update, and go back to an earlier version.

Look I can't speak for everyone, or everyone's machine, but all I know is I am totally impressed with this McAfee product, and hope and pray they don't go down the tubes like Norton, and Zone Alarm did. (I have not used any recent Norton products, but Norton was the best when Peter Norton was there solving the DOS problems, almost like a miracle man, then from about 10 years ago, everything of theirs I tried was junk.) Sorry for the pointed remarks, but sometimes you find a product, after spending years in frustration, or at least you find something that works, then it goes bad, and finally, finally, something that really works great like this MVS. For me, my hat is off to McAfee. 150 Stars and counting. Highly recommended to say the least.
PS: I noticed another reviewer was having problems logging onto online acounts, so I put it to the test, logged into my bank account, which is a 3 step process, and also my online server, and did not have any problems. If I have any, or notice anything after using this product more, I will come back and edit the review. All of the essentials place this one at the top for now.",0
My daughter just got her driver's license and I have been using this to make sure she is using the car responsibly when she by herself. It allows me to see if she goes anywhere she does not tell me about. It also allows me to monitor her speed and braking habits. It gives me peace of mind that she has reached her destination when she forgets to let me know. It also allowed me to help correct a bad habit she was acquiring of idling for long periods. I think it is an amazing tool for parents of new drivers!,0
Best antivirus because it does all the work in the background.  You never have to manually tell it to run scans.  It does all that on its own.  Perfect for the less computer literate who never would remember to manually run scans as the other name brand antivirus' expect the user to do.,0
"Trend Micro is known for reliable, easy to use software and security. Internet Security 2010 builds on this reputation and brings us an even better product for 2010.

For the casual user, this product should be sufficient. But if you are an internet junkie, you'll need something with a little more umph. Trend Micro makes excellent products which perform the duties they are intended to do. It's fine for what it is - just don't expect it to do something that is beyond what it is.

"I've recently switched from McAfee, after far too many unhappy experiences and have think I found my new PC security software company: Kaspersky.  Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 is a very capable program, but pales in comparison to their fully featured version called Kaspersky Pure.

"This is overall a great visual system for accounting , tracking, and pulling numbers and images for presentation purposes.  After you get used to everything here, it becomes second  nature (but just takes a while as with everything else).  Once I got the hang of this system, I really enjoyed it's ""depth"" the most.  Yes, it has depth (or breadth) of functionale, but what I mean is, you are really able to easily pinpoint numbers from a statement.  If you have a question about some number on an income statement, you're able to click on that for much further detail to figure out what it entails.  This kind of depth is extremely beneficial as it saves a lot of time trying to search for the meaning behind a number.",0
I bought this on the strength of my past experience with Corel products.  I haven't had time to use it but I know just from the reviews it is superior to the products I have tried in the past.  I actually bought it though as a gift for my wife who has been super busy.  It makes little difference to me when later versions become available because it is usually cheaper to buy the older version.  The current version as of the date of this review is X7.  See the review for X6 at:  [...] and for X7 at [...] and decide which is the best value for you and then decide if the best price difference is a consideration.,0
"I've been using WinZip in one form or another since I got my first computer twenty-five years ago and it's still the best program out there for compressing and decompressing large files.

For most people there's no reason to upgrade from prior versions, but for anyone wanting to make sending large files faster and more convenient with great reliability and no loss of data, I can't recommend this more.",0
"Pros:

- Excellent protection according to AV Test organization.
- Less than 1% performance hit.  (All protection software has a performance hit.  Norton has the lowest performance hit I have been able to find.)

Cons:

Renewal is more expensive than Amazon so I uninstall and repurchase every year at Amazon.",0

"Tiger, OS X 10.4 is another leap forward in the O.S. arena and Apple, once again leads the way. (Features will surely be copied by that ""other"" OS vendor.)
IF you have a G4 or G5 Mac, Tiger is a definite. For compatible G3 systems, you may not find Tiger worthwhile.
New features and stability are once again the hallmarks of this Apple software gem.
Spotlight: A remarkably speedy context search tool. The little magnifying-glass icon at the top right of the menu bar brings up Spotlight quick search. Enter a word or phrase and instantly (once the index is built) files matching by name or content will be shown to you. When you first run your Mac using Tiger, it will automatically build a Spotlight index, which can take a few hours, depending on the number and size of the files on your disk(s). The speed at which Spotlight can find files is astounding. Even if you search for a word buried in an obscure location, Spotlight can find it.
Dashboard Widgets: These are mini-applications. Icons ""float"" above your desktop and are easily accessible. Such items as a desk clock, calendar, weather monitor and iTunes player are readily usable and hundreds more can be downloaded, both from Apple and third-parties.
RSS in Safari: Now Safari is RSS capable. You can ""subscribe"" to RSS feeds to get updates throughout the day from RSS providers. News services, weather and bargain web pages are just a few examples of providers. If an RSS feed is available, Safari will recognize this and place an RSS icon in the address bar, so you can click on it to easily access the RSS information from that site.
Tiger runs smoothly. You really need at least 512 MB of memory - a gig or more would be preferable. Once you get past the initial index creation by Spotlight, Tiger feels fast.
If you are upgrading, check with the vendors of the programs and peripherals (printers, scanners, etc.) you use to make sure these are ready for OS X 10.4. Many of the reported problems are caused by incompatibility.
If you are currently running Panther (OS X 10.3) and are undecided about upgrading, you should consider the feature list. There is no dramatic speed increase (other than Spotlight vs. Finder.) The latest update (10.4.2, as of this writing) is very stable. If you want the features, go for it, it is worthwhile. If not, you can probably hold off until OS X 10.5.
If you are running anything prior to OS X 10.3, this is the time to upgrade. You will notice the speed boost. Stability and feature richness are very apparent.",0

"As a longtime Quicken user (8 years) and MicroSoft Money user (3 years) I was very disappointed when I switched to a Mac Pro last January (2009) and found no version of Money and the only available Quicken was a 2007 (pretty much unsupported and un-updated) product!

I refused to put a Windows OS on my new Mac - that would open the machine up to Windows virus attacks and other problems.

I tried ""Crossover"" which allowed me to use a Quicken for Windows program but did not require a Window OS.  That was ok but it was slow, a bit buggy, and there was no interface with ICal (so no easy alerts).

Then I found IBank!!

Not only did IBank work beautifully with my Leopard and Snow Leopard OS but it put dates and reminders into ICal with no problem.  I was very happy that it looked like a true Mac program instead of a Windows program.

Now, after 8 months of using IBank (the last version is 3.5.4) I can tell you honestly -- for my use as a home owner, on-line bill payer, watcher of credit card charges, and user of paperless monthly statements from 2 banks and 2 credit card companies -- I am VERY VERY HAPPY and please with IBank.

I highly recommend IBank!  You can use the full program for 30 days before you buy it OR you can buy it and return it for 100% money back if you do not find it to be what you need.

Amazon offers a $20 credit for people who switch to IBank from Quicken -- making the program cost $39.95 instead of $59.95!  What is not to like about that?

I have used IBank's customer service  two different times and found them to be knowledgeable, efficient, and very helpful.  They answered both questions in my first contact.

Quicken is coming out with a Mac Financial software in February- finally.  It appears to be sort of a Quicken for Mac 2010.  I will not buy it or try it!!

Why?

I resent Intuit's attitude that Mac owners don't deserve an up-to-date program for 3 years.  I don't want to support that kind of treatment to a long-time customer.  Also Intuit's new program seems to be a limited version of their Quicken for Windows programs.  I strongly suggest you check out Inuit's Q & A about the February 2010 Mac program at quicken.com.  I doubt you will want a ""fluff"" but little ""meat"" Quicken on your Mac.

IBank has had 2 updates (free to version 3 owners) within my 8 months of owning the program.  Each update came with a new complete program download and all information from my previous IBank version was transferred with no problems.

The IBank program does not allow ""direct bill pay"" like the old Quicken I was accustomed to.  However -- many banks no longer allow that service any longer either.  Both of my checking account banks (Citizens and TD Bank) do not allow direct bill pay through third party financial software any longer so I did not really suffer a loss by switching to IBank.  That may be a ""security"" protection improvement?

IBank imports Quicken data from Windows and Mac with no problems.  Set up is easy for connecting and using most bank web sites.

I used Turbo Tax for Mac (both platforms are on most versions of TTax and TaxCut CDs) last year.  I do not import information from Quicken or IBank into TTax - oI do import the personal information from previous TurboTax for Windows programs.  I cannot say anything about importing data from IBank.

I think IBank does have a lot to offer and unless you have a business or are very wealthy -- IBank should do the job for you WITH all the dependable and helpful MAC features (and connections to ICal) that you expect from your Mac.

There are some very low ratings of IBank listed in these reviews!  I do not understand why.

I know that I have not had any of the problems addressed in the poor reviews.

If you have an Intel Mac or MacBook -- I do not think there will be a problem that IBank's free customer service could not fix.  However, if there is no ""fix"" for a problem you may experience with IBank -- you lose nothing!  Just take advantage of IBank's free trial money back guarantee!!

I do not have any connection with Intuit or IBank.  I spent my time writing this review because I truly think IBank is a GREAT alternative to Quicken for any new Mac owner!!!",0
"This is a PCI card to add USB to an older computer; 3 slots on the back and one internal--this card included a USB slot in a drive-bay cover, which you can install if you've got a free bay on your PC, connecting it to the internal USB slot with a supplied cord.  The card works great on my P3-800 at work, running Windows 2000.  Installed without a bit of trouble, and works perfectly.  Following the installation directions had me up and running in a few minutes, and the PC recognized the card and loaded the drivers (which I'd put on from the install CD) immediately without a single hitch.  Good as it gets!",0

"Out of the box and had PDFs converted in less than 15 minutes

I love when this happens! I wasn't too sure about this product -- that it would be really great at converting PDFs any better than the previous OCR software I've used. My concerns were put to rest quickly.

The software loaded quickly;I tested my own PDF and it converted in to a Word doc perfectly including the images and links. It was easy and fast.

Highly recommend this software and I look forward to using it with digital pics from my cell!

UPDATE: I use this software often and it's been reliable and converts PDF's to text well, and without alot of editing.",0
As expected.  Excellent.,0
"Review is for the product, not the price.  I think it's overpriced for the lack of features compared to the windows version, so I'm looking at this strictly from the application standpoint.

I've used quicken and money varying between products since the inception of both.  But I'm one of the people who simply wants a place to keep tabs of my checking information.  I never used it for investments, for writing checks or bill pay.  So for me, I was getting a ton of features in previous versions when I was using Windows thatI never touched, and for me just cluttered up everything.

I was happy when they announced the Mac essentials version coming out this year, since I just transitioned from over 20 years of windows use to my first macbook last summer.  And while I have windows 7 running in fusion and boot camp, I wanted my financial stuff to be in the same OS as the rest of my personal things...  So I ran Ibank for the interim period, and while it suited my needs, it wasn't able to download from my bank directly, so I was manually marking things as cleared and such by comparing it to my online bank website.  Pain.  Even in the 2009 version I had in Windows of Quicken, that one also couldn't directly connect and download my data for me.  I had to download the files from my bank and then import them to quicken 2009...

Since all my bill pay is free through my bank, and I actually like the interface, I've become accustomed to that as my way of paying everything.  I haven't had paper checks in about 6 years now, so being unable to print a check from this version doesn't hinder me at all.  And since I could not directly connect with any previous version of quicken to my bank, not being able to just pay bills directly from quicken isn't a drawback for me since I never did it before.  No matter what I did previously, I had to do things in multiple locations.  For me this is the ""norm"".

The interface is nice.  I like the uncluttered feel.  It starts very quickly, unlike my 2009 quicken for windows, or even Ibank on my mac.  I instantly can see the main info.  I also like on top the ability to, with a single click, change the view from my actual balance to the online balance.  That way it's easy for me to see what hasn't cleared yet, and make sure the numbers add up.

Quick and easy on the eyes overview page, and I like the category explorer.  Makes it easy to get a good view of the last span of whatever length of time you pick.

All I wanted to track with this was my checking accounts, which I can do easier and more clearly than with any other version of money management software.  Drag and drop matching is nice too when it updates with my bank and doesn't match the proper entry and rather creates a duplicate.

If you have simple needs like me, this is a great app.  Pricey, but i'm happy with it even for the price since for the first time I can actually do the things I wanted to do all along.  If you need more complexity, avoid it like the plague, but if you're like me, it's fantastic.",0
"Please note that I am by no means an authority on software of any variety. That being said, from the perspective of a layperson, this version of Trend Micro's security software appears to be doing a sufficient job protecting me and my computer from our respective selves. The first point to mention is that setup is extremely user friendly, even with regard to some of the specific software settings. At this point I have probably meddled with the configurations as much as I ever will, as I have only utilized this product on my home PC. Nonetheless, I have taken further steps customizing my security settings than I have ever done previously simply because of this software's ease of use and thorough, yet simple, explanation of available functions. One such customization option that I have now utilized for the first time on any security software is the parental control/web browser settings. The ability to restrict specific categories of information, images, and data, as well as descriptions of each category, allows one to feel confident in what they are blocking and what they are allowing on a user specific basis.

Beyond the actual customizable functions, almost everyone probably has the same question: will this security software slow everything on my computer to a screeching halt? After a little use, it seems that this particular software has not had the same ridiculous stopping power of other security platforms that I have utilized in the past. That is, as of this moment, I am pleased with my ability to utilize this software as the issuing company recommends while continuing the use of any other applications simultaneously. All in all, I am not disappointed and, perhaps, pleased (if such a thing is possible when dealing with PC/Internet security software).",0
"I've used TurboTax for about the past 15 years to prepare my relatively simple federal and state returns.  It makes interpreting the changing and confusing tax forms, rules and instructions fairly easy to do.  While very helpful in deciding which numbers go where -- and this becomes easier and more automatic each year -- the biggest help for me is that there are no longer math errors in my forms.  I had to recheck each form at least twice when still doing the taxes on paper.  This is a big time saver.
You still have to keep good records, save receipts for reporting sales taxes from online purchases (yes, you do, even though many folks don't), keep donation receipts and a computer file (TurboTax does this for you) or paper file of previous tax years.  If you get audited, you will need the paper trail.
TurboTax offers a number of extra-cost services along the way as you work through the program;  it's up to the user to decide if they are worth the extra money.
Many state now offer free on-line state tax filing.  E-filing state taxes online costs extra from TurboTax.  Generally, you just have to enter numbers manually on a free state web site.  All the information is provided by the TurboTax printed forms, so you just copy the numbers requested.  This has worked well for me for several years.
Each year, TurboTax improves the program and makes it easier and more accessible.  I'm very satisfied with the results and will use the program next year.

"...TurboTax can help ease the pain.

This is the 15th consecutive year I've used TurboTax for our state and federal returns. Over that time, Intuit has offered some better (and weaker) versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.

If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped tame, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Tax time before TurboTax used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Happily, those days are far in the past

This version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.

With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?",0

"I'm going to do a short review here and say that Corel has some advantages over Photoshop for photomanipulation or editing. Where Photoshop Elements (a fine piece of software) has you estimate or use your monitor and judgment for fixing photos, CorelDraw's Photo suite has an Integrated Image Adjustment Lab --and it tells you how you are going to affect the data on a RAW image, losing image quality by various adjustments. Instead of eyeballing what you are doing, you can retain maximum detail in highlights and shadows using their sliders and suggestions. When you exceed the limits and start to lose detail, an exclamation point crops up on the slider, showing you that you have degraded the photo quality. This is probably the best photo editing software I've used for that reason.

While I like the competing PhotoShop Elements for ease of use and the fun effect, CorelDraw has more professional features and the interface for photoediting is full of information yet easy to use. Big thumbs up.",0

"I have used Quicken for over a decade, all the way from the DOS version of it. This is by far the worst version that I have purchased. Half the time the downloaded updates do not work and I have to do them one at a time instead of as a ""One Step Update"" (HA!). Then, usually the first time I start the program up each day, it moves as slow as a rock until I close it and re-open it again, and even then it is no speed demon. It has locked up on several occasions. Intuit seems to love to make simple things very difficult and bug it up in the process. This is a horrible version and I really wish I had not upgraded to it, but now I am stuck with it. I hope when I upgrade again, it will be much, much better.

"I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.

My biggest complaint is that once the ""virus update"" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.

I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.

"I love taking pictures with my digital camera and enjoy sharing them with family and friends. Paintshop ProX5 allows me to organize and edit my pictures as well as to share them with family and friends.

It is important for me to have an easy to use photo editing software.  This software is easy enough for someone like me to use but has features that an advanced user would enjoy.

There are three tabs at the top of the screen that help a person use the software.  The tabs are manage, adjust and edit.

The manage tab deals with organizing photos, identifying them and rating them.  The adjust tab allows you to use a lot of different features to adjust the sharpness, tone, brightness and contrast of a picture. The edit tab allows you to edit photos in more ways than I care to list.  There is an adjust option in the edit tab that allows a person to use many of the features in the adjust tab.

I have yet to use the adjust and edit features completely but I could see a professional being able to do very complicated tasks. The help menu is great and there are ways to do quick fixes which allow the software to fix up a picture for you.

"I discovered what a great little program Sketchbook was when I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learning-Autodesk-Maya-8-Foundation-DVD/dp/189717733X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learning Autodesk Maya 8|Foundation +DVD</a>. It came bundled with the book and back then it was still called ""Alias Sketchbook"". I really enjoyed drawing and making sketches with it for Flash storyboards I presented to clients. The tools felt natural and fun to use. With Sketchbook Pro 2011, Autodesk added some great new features, like symmetry drawing and layers, making it a very attractive and low-cost alternative to Photoshop, which not only costs $600+, but takes up a ton of space with a 2+ GB install. Sketchbook, by contrast, is about 160 MB on a Mac. An added bonus is that Autodesk included both PC (XP, Vista, Windows 7) and Mac versions on the same DVD. There is also no restrictive activation like Adobe products. Simply enter the serial number and product key. The software doesn't connect to a server to activate your license.

One of the key differences between Sketchbook and almost every other program on the market is use of popup rotary menus. Click and hold over any button for a split second and a context-sensitive ring of icons or options appear. This may take a bit of getting used to for people accustomed to Adobe products which has buttons arrange in floating panels. Video game players may be used to this (like Mass Effect), but almost every program on the computer is not like this. Once you get used to it though, it's very fast and intuitive -- much faster than hunting for buttons on a tools pallet. Just flick your wrist a few centimeters and you've got the right tool selected.

New Features:
Symmetry drawing splits the screen along the X or Y axis and whatever you draw on one side of the line is mirrored on the other. If you cross the divider, the symmetry simply flips around as you draw. It's a lot of fun for making web background tiles, decals or other symmetrical art... or if you want to try your hand at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-C-Escher/dp/0810981130/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.C. Escher</a>-esque tessellations.

Layers works the same way here as in Photoshop. You can create new layers, merge them, delete them, duplicate, hide visibility, lock, etc. I don't think I need to elaborate much on the usefulness of layers. This is a great addition to Sketchbook. You can export out the file as a PSD, preserving the layers.

And finally, you guessed it -- you should have a Wacom tablet. You can use this with the mouse, but without pressure sensitivity and the precision of a pen tablet, you're missing out on a great deal of the power offered by many art programs.

To sum up, a very powerful, fun, light-weight, and cost-effective tool for any digital artist. Highly recommended.",0

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

The ""Ultimate"" extras that are included in this software consist of proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software and Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects.  The proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.

Also, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",0

  I'm going to be selling a computer on EBAY in a few days and I'm anxious to try this new feature out! (P.S. Before selling any computer, it's always a good idea to reformat then run a secure file eraser like VIPRE.)

RECAP: If you're looking for new ANTI virus software, give VIPRE a look, it won't dissapoint....",0
"To test features of the new Dragon Dictate for Mac, I decided to dictate this entire review using the program. Any typos or mistakes in the review is a result of the program and not my typing. I used a previous dictation software in the early 2000s and was less than impressed with its ability to accurately type what I was saying. I thought it was time to give dictation software another try. The package comes with the install software, a quick start guide, and a USB microphone. The install took 2.3 GB of disk space. The system requirements are fairly hefty so make sure your computer can tow the line.  My test compute was a MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory and a 2.4 GHz Intel core I five processor. After the installation, you will create a profile. You will then go through voice training where you will read a story and the software will get used to your voice. After voice training, you will run through very useful tutorial which has a series of lessons to help you learn the intricacies of the software.
I was very impressed on how quickly it typed what you said. In my testing and along with this review my accuracy was close to 98%. This percentage is much better than I would get if I were typing.

The Nuance website has a number of helpful videos to help you get started in your dictation. While in command mode, you can view a list of all the things that you can say. I found this very helpful.  You can also add your own commands. The program is very easy to use, however, it will take me a while to fully utilize all its capabilities. You can also go to the Nuance website and add extensions for both Safari and Firefox.

The software was very stable. You can also use the software to transcribe an audio recording. I had no problems learning the basic voice commands. My days of hunting and pecking on the keyboard will be fewer and fewer.",0
"I just went to a local seminar hosted by an estate planning law office this week and found out how much better a living trust is if you have more than $100K in assets (that includes the equity in your home, but not IRA, 401k, or life insurance value). If you hit that threshold, your standard Will ends up being a ticket for up to 2 years in probate. You still want a will when you do a living trust as sort of a catch-all, but with that you need the proper power of attorneys set up (note that was plural). The right kind of protection is a legal will, durable power of attorney for finances, directive for health care and caregiver instructions. Plus of course you want a Living Trust as the flag ship. I just learned all this YESTERDAY, while WillMaker was on my desk waiting to be used and reviewed. This version of WillMaker offers everything on the list I just gave, including a free one year subscription to Nolo's Living Trust service. That's huge and a a huge bargain, because a Living Trust is an updatable document that should be reviewed and refined as family situations change, hence the subscription.  The law office gave us their price sheet to set up all of these docs: $2,950, seriously. Considering all that goes into creating a fully protected and executable will and trust and all the rest, that's understandable for a local law office. But put that into a well-respected software package and you can save that huge fee if you understand the process. I didn't until last night, although I did a straight will 2 years ago with WillMaker 2014. The software is very easy to follow and has been around so long, all the ""odd circumstances"" are in there. If your situation is pretty straight forward where you own a house and have some savings and dependents, WillMaker in this version with the Living Trust is the way to go. I'm thrilled this came up for review, I only have that will and if something happens my family is stuck in probate.",0

"I always buy H&R Block at the beginning of each year. As I found out H&R Block and Amazon always have a 50% discount at the beginning of each year for this software. For the past couple of years, I monitored this H&R Block SW price and I haven't found better price than this 50% discount. Here are my purchase record for the past couple of years.

I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 7 schedule K-1 forms from various private placement investments (including 2 oil exploring investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, and a sole proprietorship (for stock trading).  First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)",0

"As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios.",0
"For the first time in many years I have been pleased with a Microsoft Windows family OS.  When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.
Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.
This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.
The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)
I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.
As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.
I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:
* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever
* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start
* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP
* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically
* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP
* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.
* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.
And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.
In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.
I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.

"I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.",0
"I've been using H&R Block software for several years and have been doing my own taxes all my life.  When I think back to the early years when my returns were simple, those returns still took longer to prepare than my current ones.  And my returns today are considerably more complicated (as are the tax laws).  Yet, with H&R Block tax software, I not only can effortlessly prepare my taxes, but I also can relax knowing that I've not made a simple, perhaps stupid mistake, since the software will catch those.  It certainly can save you from having to file a 1040X as I had to do once or twice many years ago to correct one of my errors.  I've tried other software in the past but H&R Block's seems to require much less effort on my part and is much easier and more instinctive to use.",0

"I have had Mcafee installed on my computer for a month now, and what I like best is that I don't notice it is there - it doesn't slow my machine down, does its job to protect it (no viruses, malware) and doesn't intrude on my PC experience.",0
"Just so you know, I'm writing this review using the Dragon Naturally Speaking software. This is much more fun than I ever thought speech recognition software could be. It's like bossing my computer around all day. Instead of sitting at the keyboard typing out everything I want to say, I just start talking and the software does the rest. It even spells everything correctly! I tend to speak really fast sometimes but this software picks up whatever I say, and prints it out accurately, just as I say it. (You do have to tell it the punctuation to use.) It also understands commands in most of the programs that I've used it on so far, including Microsoft Outlook, Firefox, and the CRM, Maximizer, that I use daily.

I had a problem at first because my computer wasn't picking up my voice on the microphone headset. I used the ""help"" menu in Dragon NaturallySpeaking and found out that a couple of my controls were set to ""mute"" for some unknown reason. Once I corrected that all systems were go. The software had me reading a few paragraphs in order to learn my speech patterns (It learned that really fast!) and we were off and running.

Another nice feature is that you can set a key on your keyboard to make the microphone stop or start listening. When I first started using the software I was dictating an e-mail and the phone rang. I forgot that the software was still listening and started speaking to the person on the phone without paying attention to my e-mail program. Imagine my surprise when I realized the whole phone conversation was added to my e-mail! I've since learned to use the off/on key and the sleep key when I don't want the program to write out what I'm saying. Another thing I like is that you can say ""scratch this"" when you want to correct something you just said. I use that feature quite a bit.

The thing I like the best about the software is that it saves me a lot of time. I'm a pretty fast typist but I can still speak a lot more quickly than I type. And I really like ordering my computer around all day - Do this and do that and then do this and this and this. It never gets tired of listening to me or talks back which is very cool. You know those endless business e-mails that you have to reply to that seemed to take forever? This software not only lets you dictate the replies and attach copies of documents, but you can just say: ""click send"" or ""send e-mail""and voil! Off it goes! Oh, and surfing the web? I love ordering Firefox around, telling it to go here, go there, find this or find that. It's like my wish is its command. And it doesn't back-talk at the end of the day, it only wants to do more. Yeah, I really love this software. It not only saves me time but it's big fun to play around with.",0
"I'm a 20 year PC veteran who recently bought a Mac PowerBook.

Overall, I still prefer this to the built in windows compression tool.

"After an audit in 2006, we really needed to keep our records in order. It is one of the biggest business chores you need to stay on top of. Especially for solo small business owners.

Although everything was in order, keeping track of all those receipts, invoices, vendor records, ect... was absolutely overwhelming. Especially when you are trying to run the daily operations of your business.

Trust me when I say, ""being audited is no fun and is a scary thing to go thru"". We were lucky to have gotten a a good agent to deal with and was enough patient with us. This is definitely not the case with most.

I do like this software very much, but the software is only as good as the one who is inputting the data.

Installation was simple without any issues. We upgraded from the 2009 Pro version. However, we are still running older versions of other software because we trust them and they work for us... so far.

Windows XP Pro SP3
Microsoft Office 2007

The file attachment feature is great, mainly because we can attach receipts and invoices to individual accounts and helps pinpoint our expenditures and operational costs, i.e. fuel, motel, food, vehichle repair and maintenance, etc...

Although this is a new install, only 2 months, thoroughly, we have not put it through the ringer yet. As we are progressive in using more of the features, we will update our review.

Overall, I am completely satified with this software and hope that it will be a functional tool for our record keeping. Because an audit is a huge distraction, causes much mental anguish, and is terrible waste of valuable time.",0

"The thing that I dread most every year is filing my tax return. I usually wait until the last minute, as the chore is definitely something that I don't look forward to doing.

Since I buy and sell stocks on a regular basis, I wanted a tax program that would be able to import the information from my online brokerage firm. Never in my wildest imagination, did I expect to find a software program that made the process so easy. When I filed my return for 2012, I spent the better part of a day manually inputting this information to my IRS 1040 form. This year was totally different. With the click of a button and signing into my online brokerage account, it literally took just a few seconds to import not only my stock purchases and sales, but also to import interest and dividends. Since I only want to spend 1 day a year doing my taxes, I actually spent more time manually writing my estimated tax checks and envelopes than I did using this software to file both my federal and state returns.

The bottom line is that this product is the best one that I've ever used for filing taxes. It makes it so easy and totally eliminates the frustration that usually comes with this task.",0

"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.

But AVG blows Norton out of the water.  I started using it because everyone I know who works in IT (which is a lot since I work in IT) recommended it.  Now I swear by it because I have been virus free for 3 years running AVG just with the free version.  And the internet security features that the paid version offers are second to none!

"I found Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate a very usable video editing program for my modest needs. It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

Hope this helps someone.",0

I also used this software to expand my laptop hard drive capacity using the cloning feature. So far I have cloned three of my laptops' hard drives to the higher capacity 500 GB drives without any problems. It is quite useful particularly with the low hard disk drives cost nowadays.

Another beauty of this backup software is that it allows you to browse the contents of the  backup file with a windows explorer like interface and selectively restore the files without have to manually launch the recovery option from the menu. If you register this software on the Acronis product website, you would also be able to download the latest updates of the same version (fully installable file, not patches) for free by logging in your account.",0
Dragon Dictate for Mac transcribes audio files of a speaker's voice from podcasts or recorded audio files.  You can also compose and reply to emails in Gmail via dictation or full text controls. Latency has also been reduced with pure 64-bit application and improved memory. Better speech recognition technology also improves accuracy over previous Dragon Software offerings.,0
This is a great extension to the Windows 98 line of operating systems. Unfortunately it is also the last in that line. The flexibility of having a modern operating system with Dos compatibility was a great idea so long as it was handled correctly.,0
"I installed Parallels 7 on a Mac Mini using an ISO file on our business network.  This is the third install I have done of P7 (the others were at home using a Win 7 DVD).  With this latest install, I was getting a key error in an unattended answer file,  finally fixed this by deleting the floppy drive from the list of boot options during the install.  You have to check the ""configure paralles now"" checkbox during the first couple of screens of the install.  Once P7 is installed, it is a pleasure to use.  Windows applications can work along side Mac apps, or you can have a full scrree. widows desktop accessible with your Mac swipe.  Program run fast, although the Mi I'd fan will really crank if I'm using Windows heavily.  Printing through the Mac is seamless, network drives are all there, and I can share files between the two systems.  I have not come across any bugs yet. Very stable performance.",0

"We used Turbo Tax up until about 4 years ago when I had a problem trying to report an income item that just didn't want to plug into the right spot correctly. We switched to H&R Block that year and never looked back. Our taxes aren't terribly complicated but tax laws seem to change every year for one thing or another. H&R Block  does all the under the hood calculating which keeps things simple for me, the user, and that's what I like.  And after the federal form was finished, it downloaded my state return and filled everything in and probably under a minute.  The interface was easy to understand and didn't contain any  superfluous stuff that we didn't need.  I purchased the download version on Amazon and installation was quick and simple. Two thumbs up for a great text program!",0

"I'll admit, I've been running Windows 7 for six months now: the preproduction version of it and have just upgraded to the gold code.  So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system.  Let's get to the nitty gritty:

Should you upgrade from Windows Vista?  YES!  I mean it - upgrade today.
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.  Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2.

Should you upgrade from Windows XP? Maybe, but for different reasons.
XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good.  However, XP is old as an operating system.  Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7.  That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system.

64 bit or 32 bit?
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section.  If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better.  If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now.

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
I recommend you have:
-a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine
-4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market)
-good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50)
-back up your files to a USB drive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-My-Passport-Essential-500-GB-USB-2-0-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-WDME5000TN-Midnight-Black/dp/B001F9LY14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black)</a>
-check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7

INSTALLATION:
Installation was very straight forward.  You put in the CD and reboot your machine.  You might have to enter your bios and enable the ""boot from CD"" option.  Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation.  You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation.  I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system.  It worked great.
The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider.
I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should  help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition.  I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front.  That said, I recently upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-CP2025DN-Color-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B001F0RI1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer</a>&nbsp;that I love so no real loss there.  I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print.  Everything else upgraded.

BENEFITS
-faster boot time
-faster go to sleep
-faster wakeup
-faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond)
-joining wireless networks is much easier
-the interface is just plain beautiful
-my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture)
-Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop.  I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me
-Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running
-Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data.  It's great!  I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files!
-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love.
-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-3User-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010</a>. Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but

CONS:
- Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver.
- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS.

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET?
I got the ultimate version because I have clients who ask, ""is your hard drive encrypted?"" -- I wanted to be able to say yes and have sensitive data encrypted one of my computer volumes - Bitlocker is only available in the Ultimate version.  Ultimate also includes Multilanguage support.

If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition.  If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining.  Also Windows Professional gives you the option to run applications in XP mode so if you have old applications you can use that nifty feature.  I already have 1 application running in XP mode - it's nifty to run an old application.

NOTE:
The box contains both the 32 bit and 64 bit OS.

OVERALL:
It's very hard to write a comprehensive review on an entire operating system so I didn't even try - I'm sure magazines will devote entire articles to the operating system and several books will come out.  My goal here is just to give everyone a glimpse of what I've found to date with this new OS. I do hope this has helped you in making a decision.

Hats off to Microsoft on Windows 7.  It's more of a refined Windows Vista than an entirely new operating system but it was needed.  Thank you.",0
"Like the whole new 2007 Office Suite it takes a bit of getting used to.  However from the get go things are so much more intuitive with Outlook.

"I have an older macbook so I can't take full advatange of this upgrade, but I still bought it. Why you might ask?

I am always impressed with Apple and when I heard that they had cisco vpn built in along with Microsoft exchange support it was a no brainer for me. I am a Systems Admin and lug my windows laptop to and from work daily because I needed the ability to vpn into the office to support servers after hours. With Snow leopards built in support I can now leave the windows beast at work and use my mac while at home. I did find out that Remote Desktop really isn't supported in the non server level Snow Leopard, at least not that I could find and to get the Mac version would cost a lot. Microsoft however does have a free download for Mac called Remote Desktop for Mac version 2.1 and it works beautifully with the Cisco VPN and Exchange to really bring my ability to provide support to where I always wanted it to be on my mac!

Like I said I don't get full access to all the bells and whistles, but for the reasons I mentioned above it was an easy choice to upgrade. Plus the savings in disk space, speed to start up and shut down and all the other visual enhancements really makes this a winner.

If anyone is aware of an Apple version of RDP that is FREE let me know, I hate to use Microsoft products on my mac but for now that was the only free solution I could find without running a VM and I wasn't about to fork out the big bucks for the Apple version that includes that.

Way to go apple, another solid product and another terrific enhancement. It's nice to see a computer company put out software to make their older hardware run FASTER and not put something out like microsoft does where you need to upgrade to make it work. Redmond better get with it, and the price for Snow Leopard is so affordable.

I will say I did purchase my copy through the Apple store directly and had it shipped to my house on the day it was released. I was sad to see that Amazon was going to take a few days to get it to me but I understand that essentially it was Apple that caused that delay. For those of you upset amazon isn't getting the product to you on release day, please don't write negative reviews. These reviews are for the product and NOT your discontent with amazon.",0

"I've been using tax software annually for a while now, since it simplifies an otherwise excessively complicated process. This Turbo Tax package features both federal and state returns, which is convenient. This premier version of Turbo Tax differs from the basic version by including an audit risk meter (which is supposed to help reduce the chance of an audit) and Itsdeductible (which is meant to accurately calculate the value of donated items) as well as information on maximizing deductions and credits. It differs from the deluxe version by having additional information about investment sales and rental property income/expenses/refinancing, as well as a retirement tax help and IRA tool.

As with most tax programs, TurboTax works step-by-step and showcases your total refund amount as you go along. So far this program looks promising, but I will update this review as the tax season is closer and I'm able to use it more.",0
Pretty good internet security software to protect from virus and malware and online threats. My family had Kaspersky for 3 years between 2009 and 2012. Then we tried Norton 360 for two years.

"I used CorelDraw many years ago but I made a switch to Adobe starting with freehand and Illustrator.  There was a little bit of a learning curve because I am use to Adobe. Thankfully there are video tutorials to help with the learning aspect.

CorelDraw Home and Student is almost as powerful as illustrator but at a much lower cost.  You just have to invest the time to learn it.

In addition to the vector drawing you also have the capabilites of photo editing.  Making the suite a bargain for home and student. The catch is you are not allowed to use this for commercial purpose, which means you can sell the images / work that you create with CorelDraw Suite.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who want to get into vectors grapics without the high cost of Adobe and learning curve that comes with the free inkscape.",0

"I have taken a number of classes to learn a variety of languages (French formal classes, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic to name a few), and have forgotten most of them all. Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.

Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.

While the process has been much quicker, more of a review, than with the Spanish version, I have followed the lesson plans to get a true feel for the software. Learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.

My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Paris. P-)",0

"The Rosetta Stone program is truly ingenious.  I have spent the last two months using the program and the amount you can learn in that time is by far superior to memorization or learning from a book.  Rosetta Stone works the same way you learn your first language - without translation memorization.  It seems a little repetitive as you go along, but when you realize how much you remember without any prompting or memorization, it's truly amazing.  I just returned from a trip to Italy and the program helped me communicate, and perhaps more importantly, really taught me the fundamentals of the language and pronunciation.  Therefore, I could look up a word in a small phrasebook if needed, and feel confident when speaking to locals.  I highly recommend the Rosetta Stone program for those who want to learn a new language.  The fact that the headphones will listen to you and confirm if you are using correct inflection and pronunciation is very helpful in giving you the confidence to begin using your newly learned language in the real world.",0

"WinZip is the file compression software to beat.  There are certainly many other companies trying to compete with this ongoing trustworthy tool, but you will always go back to WinZip if you ever stray away.

There are plenty of tools on board to work with various media and file types.  You can attach your work from the program to email. You can shink or resize files before compressing, saving even more space.  And it features an easy to understand and helpful organization system that will keep track of every file and it's location.

"There may be some people out there that don't like QuickBooks, but I'm not one of them. Perhaps because my needs aren't as robust, but I don't experience any of the problems I've read about.

One thing off the bat: the QB methodology is way more intuitive to non-accounts than any other program I've used, which for me is a good thing: I'm not an accountant. Invoices, purchase orders, credits, payments etc are all easily entered and, more importantly, modified if need-be. I remember using a more traditionally set-up accounting program in the past and some of those operations were almost impossible to figure out (though as I said, for real accountants those programs may be more intuitive, and QB more frustrating).

Frankly, I haven't run into any problems that I couldn't figure out myself, and I've been able to get the program up and running exactly as I want it to run, quickly and easily. Any errors I've run into at all were quickly rectified by doing a database rebuild, so I've been quite happy.  Add to that the utter confusion I experienced using competing products and there's nothing out there that I'd rather use.

It may not be the be-all and end-all if you're an accountant, but I've yet to find anything that I want to do with it that I can't, and it's done everything I've asked without a hiccup. Considering what I used to pay my accountants in New York every month, this is a total winner.",0

"I have been using Windows 7 for over a month now. (Received an early copy) I must admit the upgrade experience is a hassle but once you install Windows 7 you will be pleasantly surprised. I recommend a clean install for all users. Windows 7 has a noticeably snappier boot time than Windows Vista. What users will notice most are the changes to the interface. It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions. Windows 7 also includes a comprehensive device drivers, I have only had an issue with an old printer where Windows 7 could not find the drivers. But with Virtual XP this was no problem, I simply installed the Virtual XP, and used my printer within the virtualized environment.

Improvements/Pros/New Features
-New Taskbar interface, each program is represented by an icon for a clutter free taskbar
-Quicker boot times
-Comprehensive driver library
-Supports many devices out of the box
-Less annoying
-Virtual XP (for those who still need Windows XP)

"The following review is written under the umbrella idea that CorelDraw Suite is one of the best I have ever used and I can not stand going without it.  However, it is not without its frustrations.  This version is better than previous versions in many ways.  I will attempt to list a few of my frustrations here so if you run into them, you are not surprised.  Still the program is worth it and I highly recommend it.

I tested the 64bit version, it also comes with 32bit as well.
---------------

CorelDraw- a topic in my household since version 3, which is a very long time ago.  I was so excited about checking out the new X7 version that I could hardly stand it.

WHAT WAS I THINKING?

Okay, so CorelDraw is notorious for having some crazy bugs in it.  More than one graphic artist has asked in a variety of ways, what kind of sparkling mind designed some of the things in each new addition.  Some use more choice words than others.

I have had pretty good results with most of the newer versions of CorelDraw over time.  I have encountered some pretty odd quirks from time to time, including some which have been downright embarrassing if not caught before submitting documents.

However, this time around, I figured with the 64 bit version- WOW this ought to really be FAST.

And it is.

I guess the exciting part is that this time around I can rush more quickly from one ANNOYING BUG TO THE OTHER without having to wait as long as before.  I mean, REALLY.  I realize that the updates have not been released yet, so please take this review with a grain of salt.  I am sure updates will be released that will fix some of this stuff.....I hope.

COREL DRAW
First of all, the program is a lot faster.  WHEE!  At least I can run through things a little more easily.  Until the program reboots itself, of course.  Do NOT get me started.

CorelDraw has a great amount of features in it.  It is a wonderful graphics program and one would hope it will work out well often enough so that you don't have to get too frustrated and don't slow your work load down too much.

This time around, well, to begin with, I was editing some documents that I did in a previous version- CorelDraw X5.  It was not THAT long ago that the program was out, so I didn't think I should run into too many problems.

Guess again, sucker!

Here is a list of my first exciting day with this new version:

Outline Tool:
Where did it go?  I looked everywhere for it.  I went to the help files.  I went everywhere and the places it was listed did not tell how to install outlines or change the color- very basic tool.  After a half hour of looking and experimenting- I found it.  It is a bit random and didn't make any sense to me, but once I got the hang of it, I was good to go.

Printer bugs:
I have two printers on my system.  I have an HP Envy 4300 and a Officejet K550.  I have not had any issues with these printers on any other program or system- except CorelDraw.  The program will suddenly cause an issue and then shut down the complete program.  If you plan to use this program until there are updates, PLEASE SAVE YOUR WORK CONSTANTLY in case it decides to shut down BEFORE it backs up your file as you work.

OUTLINE TOOL- AGAIN
It used to be if you highlighted any text - either artistic or paragraph that ONLY THAT TEXT would change color, but not any more.  Outlines and text color will not only change on the word you highlight, but on the entire document contained in that box.  TALK ABOUT ANNOYING.  Then you have to go change the other text BACK where you want it.  ARGH!

Just when I was about to give up on the whole thing, I tried one more time- and VOILA!  It worked.  I got confident that all was well, and BAM back to random again.  It seems that there is a bug when you access the fill for text from the tool bar vs the text properties dock on the right side.  I plan to explore this further.  Since I am not allowed a lot of time to test this extensively, I am just giving you what I have discovered in the few weeks of using it.

PREVIOUS FILES
When I have chosen some files that I have previous worked on in CorelDraw X5, get ready for a fun ride.  First of all you have to have the files converted to the new font/text engine in X7.  If you don't you will get some odd performance from the file if you try to edit or print.

Then if you try to print the files after working on them a bit- or not- even if used as is- sometimes a page will randomly print really really tiny and then no other pages in the document will print that way- even though they all print fine on previous versions.  So here you are with a document that suddenly goes into micro mode.  It took a lot of effort to get it to print normally again.  Better to start that page over, but again, TIME CONSUMING.

PHOTO PAINT
This is where the 64bit improvements really start to become interesting.  In past versions, sometimes when I wanted to do some photo work, I would open quite a few photos and work between them.  It was clunky and frustrating at times.  Also at times, I found that the system would choke and I might have to restart the program.

This time around, the program is much easier to work with.  The photos are all laid out in a much nicer manner.  Each photo is like a file folder which has a tab at the top.  Moving between photos is much easier and quicker.  I LOVE that feature.

Also, I have opened photos which were adjusted with previous versions of Corel Photopaint and was very surprised at how much nicer they turned out.  I find that the tools are more efficient and end up with much nicer results than in some previous versions.

I have been working extensively with CorelDraw and am still very pleased with this version.  Despite some frustrating bugs, the 64bit version is faster and seems to be more efficient especially when dealing with photos.

FINAL COMMENTS
There is so much I can comment on with this program and so much that I would like to talk about.  However, Amazon only wants limited review space, so I will stop there.

Despite the frustrations, I expect some of them to be corrected with future updates.

I have seen better performance in the photo area but also the options for the Draw area as well.  The documentation and training videos available are helpful and extensive if you want to take the time to use them.  It is also intuitive for learners who like to dive in, but some things can be hard to locate and figure out without looking it up.

I highly recommend CorelDraw Graphics Suite X7.  The improvements are worth any frustrations.

"To test features of the new Dragon Dictate for Mac, I decided to dictate this entire review using the program. Any typos or mistakes in the review is a result of the program and not my typing. I used a previous dictation software in the early 2000s and was less than impressed with its ability to accurately type what I was saying. I thought it was time to give dictation software another try. The package comes with the install software, a quick start guide, and a USB microphone. The install took 2.3 GB of disk space. The system requirements are fairly hefty so make sure your computer can tow the line.  My test compute was a MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory and a 2.4 GHz Intel core I five processor. After the installation, you will create a profile. You will then go through voice training where you will read a story and the software will get used to your voice. After voice training, you will run through very useful tutorial which has a series of lessons to help you learn the intricacies of the software.
I was very impressed on how quickly it typed what you said. In my testing and along with this review my accuracy was close to 98%. This percentage is much better than I would get if I were typing.

The Nuance website has a number of helpful videos to help you get started in your dictation. While in command mode, you can view a list of all the things that you can say. I found this very helpful.  You can also add your own commands. The program is very easy to use, however, it will take me a while to fully utilize all its capabilities. You can also go to the Nuance website and add extensions for both Safari and Firefox.

The software was very stable. You can also use the software to transcribe an audio recording. I had no problems learning the basic voice commands. My days of hunting and pecking on the keyboard will be fewer and fewer.",0
"Corel Painter 2015 is a really professional program. It is an incredible package of tools that you can use to create or modify images in an unbelievable amount of ways. This is not a program that is for beginners, but with some time and use it becomes something that even a non professional such as myself is able to use to do some really exciting things.

I have been a Corel user since 2008 and own several software packages from them, including Photo and Video ones, and had Painter X3, now the upgrade Corel Painter 2015. At first, I went on YouTube and watched a few tutorial videos to get some ideas of how to use this software, and I recommend that if you are not familiar with this software its a good place to see some good reviews and tutorials. Also I have a friend who does professional photography and uses software of this level and he was impressed with it and showed me (and still is) some of the many things this packages can do.

I know many people who own and compete with their horses. My photographer friend takes excellent photographs of the riders at these events. I have now learned to take some of his amazing photos and transform them into incredible works that look like brilliant paintings. I modify the picture and send them the image file as gifts and they take it to a print shop and have them printed, matted and framed professionally. It is really impressive what you can do with this software. I am learning new things all the time. This is a really good upgrade, added features but still familiar to use.

This software has a LOT and is not at first something that a novice will grasp, but with time you will, and I can safely say you will be amazed by what it can let you do. If you are a professional, I would say that Corel Painter 2015 is every bit as good as some of the other programs being sold.

Highly recommended.",0
"Great product , works as described",0
"I have been using TurboTax for years.  The transfer of data from prior years is fast and easy.  I use it when it first comes out each year to do some quick tax calculations to plan my year end transactions.  For planning purposes where one does not have all the various forms from financial institutions, one must force the program to ignore certain missing information, or go back to the paper copies of the various forms received from those institutions in prior years.  These problems, of course, go away when one is doing the actual tax return, since those forms for the current year would be at hand.  This is only a problem when doing early estimates without the various forms.

I like that the program is constantly updated as one approaches the actual filing time, so that everything is current and up to date at the time of filing.

A good solid product that gets better each year.

Be sure to buy the level of Turbo Tax that you need for your own particular situation - since moving up their product line can be expensive.",0
"It is refreshing to have a game show up in the industry that seems sold out to blood and gore that is purely fun entertainment.

It also provides 7 GB of online storage in SkyDrive. This provides the full suite of Office Applications for business use. I highly recommend. I have been using Office for years and can't imagine doing my job without this product.",0

Great deal for three computers. Only one year but the ones I needed to license were older and may not even be needed after a year.

Once you set it up it runs on it's own and so far I have not hav a single virus kill any of my computers in many many years.,0
"I recently upgraded to Quicken Deluxe 2009 from the 2008 version of the same product.  I have no regrets, and believe it was well-worth the money.  I find the program works smoother and faster for me than 2008.  Converting my data files was a snap, and I have experienced no problems downloading transactions from my bank.  Not purchasing Quicken 2009 immediately upon release may account for my lack of issues with it.  I always wait until my bank insures compatibility with a new version before I buy it. The delay also gives Intuit time to correct any bugs that existed initially.

The graphics are fresher and brighter for 2009.  The task bar is a welcome addition.  Navigating through the program is easier than in previous versions.

If you use personal financial software several times each day, as I do, then this upgrade is easily worth the price in the improvements present.  If you are considering Quicken for the first time, I am aware of no other financial management package that comes to close to the quality and features found here.",0
"Parallels made it extremely easy to convert a Virtual PC 7 file to a Windows installation on my Intel iMac. Since the Windows code runs natively on the Intel processor, the execution is fast. The ease of moving from Mac to Windows is amazing and seamless. Through the use of snapshots it is easy to return to a previous working configuration when Windows decides to start acting up.",0
great product,0
As advertised.,0
"Very powerful software, but the power comes with a price; a fairly steep learning curve. While a handful of features are automatic, to truly get the most out of this software requires significant training. Fortunately Corel has educational resources available both in the software (simplistic) and online (greater depth). A few new features make this only marginally more useful than version X7. The automatic features, such as ""One-Step Fix"" may help a at times, but I find that often the ""Fix"" is a bit too heavy-handed in one direction or another. A tailored approach is more effective.
If you're looking for easy to use software to do minor touch up work, Adobe Lightroom may be a better choice. If want the power of a relatively full-featured editor and are willing to spend time learning, but don't want to pay the steep price of Adobe Photoshop, this is a very good product.",0
"Item arrived in a timely manner, securely packaged. I have used this product since 2006. Very user-friendly, easy to follow and complete forms. Data can be brought forward from the prior year. Very nifty features such as error checking and estimating your risk of an audit. E-filing is included.",0
"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.",0
"It's been working like a charm for the last 5 years, non-stop.

"About 10 years ago, I bought my first copy of Photoshop. Or, rather...  I bought a copy for the company I worked for. I thoroughly enjoyed learning all the things I could do to a photo with that program. I'll admit that I wasted quite a few hours of my work days playing around with it and modifying some of my own family photos. Since I left that company about seven years ago, I have been without that program and the fun that it brought me. Now, I finally have a copy of it to play with, again!

This new version of Photoshop has quite a few differences from the version I had all those years ago, but it didn't take too long to pick up on most of its features. The program is very user-friendly, and it is so widely used that it isn't hard to find tutorials out on the web that describe what you would be looking to do with it. Though the novelty of the program isn't what it was the first time around, I am still having a lot of fun tinkering with and improving upon some of the family photos I have taken over the past few years.

The price is quite affordable, too. I have noticed that some of the things I could do in my last edition of Photoshop are absent from this version, though it seems more features are downloadable for a fee. This is something you need to be aware of if you plan on really doing artsy things with this program. Though the initial cost is low, you might end up paying a bit more for some of those ""premium"" tools.

Overall I am quite happy with this product at this price. I just wish I had more time to play with it than I do! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who takes their photography hobby seriously.",0
"This year Turbo Tax Deluxe was easier to use than in years past.  I think part of the reason might be for the very reason why Turbo Tax took a real hit this year because as most of us we just buy what we have always purchased without looking at it.  Intuit changed their products this year.  While this product in the past included home business schedules this year you had to upgrade if you had income from rental property or investments.  In years past I had stocks and bond investments but no more so the TurboTax Deluxe worked great for me.  It figured out with a few questions who I could take for dependents, in these hard times we have helped to support more people so we needed to know who we could take and who we could not.  And then of course the new big elephant in the room, healthcare.  With one or two questions that was also taken care of very easily.  Thank you for a great product that keeps on helping with these burdensome rules and regulations that are so complicated that to do it on our own would probably be a real nightmare.  I might add that Intuit sent me an email, because I created an account to tell me that they were offering  to help you buy the upgrade if you purchased the Deluxe and really needed the Premier.  A very nice gesture.",0
"First one I ever bought, so far so good.  Seems to work well and installation was easy, except that the installation instructions were difficult to follow.  I called my cable company and they helped me figure out what to do.",0
"One for being a new OS and one for being a successor OS. As a new paradigm, I'd give it a 5. As a successor to Win7? Not even a 2. It's a fork of the OS family - not an advancement. You would think MS would have learned this. Every other release sucks. Perhaps that's by intent - a learning experience that users will pay to vent about. MS then collects the information and uses it to produce a working OS.

Thus, Win3.11 leads to NT3.5 which in turn leads to NT4 and then WinME/2000 to Vista (oh wait, two failures in a row!) to Win7 (the big winner since NT4) and now, Win8.

If you're a touch user or a tablet user or a new user or a user who just wants a computer for social media interaction and some document management plus photo manipulation, congrats. Win 8 is for you. Once you figure it out. Apps for you to buy and MS to sell you and make money with. Applications to do real work. A desktop for that occasional use - once you know where it is.

But if you're a dev or a power user of any kind. Wow. No way. Win 7 or perhaps a general move to Mac. Sure, you'll lose a lot of software and the software you do get will most likely be a generation behind, but you'll have superior hardware and a better interface.

Come on MS. Release Win8 for the masses. We get that. Then release Win8Power or Win8Pro or Win8Real. Whatever. Don't make things like the desktop and multi-tasking and the start menu afterthoughts. Don't make me buy Apple.

So - are you old? Don't care about computers outside the love you'd give a toaster? Then Win8 is for you.

Are you a computer user instead of an app user? Then Win8 is a mess. Just a hot mess. Stick with Win7 and wait for Win9. Pray that they learn their lesson and don't drink their own kool aid. And if they do? Well, it'll give you time to save up for that MacBookPro you want. Or iMac 27"".",0
"This update has been a long time coming, but worth the wait.  One of the most basic improvements is that you can now run Microsoft office native on the Intel based Macs.

I like the multiple floating palettes.  It allows me to organize commonly used functions better than in previous versions.",0

"I have had many versions of this software, and enjoy painting with Painter soooo much.  Every iteration of this software brings new features, and improved stability - especially for Mac, and this software is for two platforms, including Windows.

You would not paint with your mouse, so you'd need a tablet (I recommend a Wacom (If you have the cash, their Cintiq is amazing, because you are actually painting right on a display of your painting and drawing).  If not, there are some much less expensive tablets that bring a plethora of features as well, like pressure-sensitivity and such. The pens that come with them all have features, as the tablets that are customizable.

I have found that the community of experts, and Corel affiliated Painter masters, are teachers, artists, software creators, and tech people.  They often donate a more than a fair amount of media that they have created, that mimic real world media, and you can load them on your computer.  How would you like to have brushes mimic cloud formations, trees and tree leaves, water, and even skin textures for portraits.  Also, there is a great amount of videos, advice, and demonstrations on their blogs, websites, and You Tube.  I've been taught by several Painter masters in inexpensive classes, as well as one-on-one classes.

When your warranty is up you may renew it.  You can get deals included sometimes with a couple of free hour lessons with a master. Just to let you know, the price may increase as you click on the link, and you need to make sure that you get the special on the page with the link. May have been a bug.

Actually, if you follow these Painter Masters by doing a Google search, and peruse their websites and who they provide links to, you will see some very good resources, at a very low cost or free.  I cannot remember all their names, but WOW! I've found some similar resources for Adobe Photoshop, but this thing with Corel Painter is so special to me. I even have a Master as a private tutor online at a very reasonable price!!

The product interface, features, and tools:

Painter is set up amazingly similar to Photoshop, like dock-able palettes and have many other like features, tools, capabilities; though, Photoshop is not Painter and vice versa.

Painter 2015 has a fun new feature, called particle brushes (so creative), and other new features as well  The previous versions brought features like the Perspective tool, and symmetry tools for those who need help drawing objects like buildings, and reflections in water, for example.  Kaleidoscopes can challenge the talented, even though most anyone can use the Kaleidoscope tool, and have it look Awesome.

Corel, in it's inception, from what I understand, was derived from a different company, and as well as I can remember,  there was a brilliant set of filters, called KPT collection = Kai's power tools.  They were brilliant, and could challenge any brainiac artist with endless possibilities, as well as make non-artists look more talented.  Well, that is how I feel about, for example, the brush creation engine within Painter.  It is so complex, and there are seemingly endless possibilities to customize existing native brushes (there are sooo many of them to begin with) to mimic nature and special effects; in my opinion it is much better than Adobe's current brush-making technology, though I use both, because digital artists are using both, hence it has been worked out that the two are not only used together by Painter masters,  but there are built-in compatibility features, tying them both in together if you will, as with Painter's ability to import Photoshop files.

I am taking more brush-engine classes, mainly because I am interested sunsets, landscapes, atmospheric renderings, and maybe even Aurora Borealis renderings.  If I make my own brushes it will help me to be knowledgeable to not only create what I envision, but know the possibilities and limitations of said brushes. The class is less than $50. In my opinion, this deal is sweet.  You can take online classes for beginners, intermediate, and master classes from Corel training partners.

You can extend your media choices multi-fold, like making and loading new brushes, patterns, papers for textures like real artist's canvas, masks, and much more, even abstract. And, yes, there are layers, masks, and channels, as well as layer settings similar to Photoshop, and Corel's own set of filters from decoration, and special effects, to color correction.

It is impossible for me to say all that this wonderful tool can do in a review, but get prepared to be blown away.  It can be as deep or as shallow as you desire.  Corel's website has a lot of videos, introducing the beginner, and veteran artist/user. Please register your software.

You don't have to be a real artist.  I am a hobbyist, trying to be an artist, but be prepared to be blown away by all things Corel Painter.  It is a deep program. No art supplies necessary, and you have convincing oils, watercolors, gouache, acrylics, pencils, pastels, pens, markers, and much more.

When you open up Painter flip through the many fine art and concept art paintings that are made by masters, some whom you can meet through the internet, or in books about Painter.

Beginners and masters may use the cloning features differently I believe.  Clones of course are copies, and it is difficult to explain in one review, but it takes knowledge of Painter's capabilities to realize that one can use a combination of cloning and talent to make something that one would have to admit, can just take talent, frankly.  Not at all cheating.  Art.  I would name names here, but I would inevitably leave someone out. I have seen that the auto-painting feature can render a photo to look as if it is painted - sort of.  Beginners will have fun, and masters use this feature creatively, and with creative uses of it.

Do I need to say I highly recommend?  Have fun, and save money on art supplies.  The digital art revolution is for traditional artist too (you can mix the media even).  From what I have read, though many artists disagree with, and I agree with, the revolution can be compared to the digital photography revolution, many years ago.  It took time for people to regard the resulting images as art.",0
I installed this after my Mcafee expired and was worried I might miss the Mcafee I had become accustomed to.  I have not missed it at all and I have had no problems whatsoever since installing this software.  The installation was relatively easy.  There were a couple of questions I was unsure about how to answer but that seems to have no impact on the performance.  The scans do not seem to tax the computer overmuch and are effective.  I feel totally comfortable with having this software as my sole protection software.  Recommend.,0
"We've been running Trend Micro for the last 10+ years, and thought it was pretty good. Then we started having serious problems with our computers, specifically slowing down, failing to recognize hyperlinks, failing to transmit passwords properly (e.g., the New York Times), interference with websites (e.g., amazon failing to operate properly) and the security software itself turning off spontaneously. Yet this software failed to recognize the problem.

So, I loaded the free security software that comes with Windows 7 (Microsoft Security Essentials), and in short order it identified two notorious pieces of malware (VCQ.exe and DropInSavings) plus seven lesser ones. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to reach the conclusion to replace Trend Micro with Microsoft Security Essentials or some other security software that actually works.",1

"I've used this product in the past, so was a little familar with WillMaker Plus. It's pretty standard software. Load onto the computer and follow the steps to download it.

You can only use it for one person, so don't think about sharing it unless you want to purchase one that allows you to share with others.

As for this software... It even has a video to help you get started and to import contacts. Once you register, then you go right into the setting up your will.  In addition to a will, you get to create a durable power of attorney document, a health care directive and other documents that you may need. You can even create a final arrangements checklist for your survivors.

WillMaker also gives you other forms that are not really part of your will, but useful for folks. This includes such things as authorizations for minors, a housesitting agreement, request for a birth certificate. There is really a lot of forms that you may use in your lifetime, but probably several you never will. But WillMaker tries to cover all the bases.

It's convenient and easy to use if you're looking for a low cost alternative to hiring an attoreny.",0
"I stress-tested this product by purchasing 1,000 ft of CAT5e stranded UTP cable and connecting both ends using RJ-11 connectors and just one pair of copper conductor.  Although the manufacturer recommends solid copper telephone wires, I thought I'd give it a shot anyways.  The results were impressive.  I got 50 Mbps on the other side and a SpeedTest.net test confirms the same internet speed I get when using my local Giganet LAN (i.e. around 30 Mbps).  Highly recommended product, principally if you need to take a ride on an unused pair of telephone wires to extend a LAN. Bravo B&B.",0

while it is a bit different it is not far from past versions, people don't like change sso they complain about small things.

"I'm a long-time fan of Ancestry.com and their products, and this was not a let down. They have an extensive depth to their products, and allow you to create a wonderful history that you can easily share with others. This is not something that you need to buy ever year, even though they put one out every year. The updates they have done since last year's release aren't that substantial that it warrants paying the money for. But every other year or few years, yes. Better editing and searching capabilities, and general fine-tuning make it worth it at that point.

If you're not familiar with the products, FTM offers your standard build-a-tree and supplies the capability to enter in a large amount of data. It can handle upwards of 2,500 names, allows for records and pictures to be associated with one or several people, and even states the relation between you and the person you are looking at or editing. You can sync the software and the online information easily, but I prefer to leave my separate. I use the free trial that comes with the software to gather as much data as I can. If I even smell something that might be a hint, I grab it up. Once my time is over, I use it to sort through things. If I come across something I need to investigate further, I purchase individual records where I can, or make note of it for the next time I buy it.

If you are looking to get into genealogy, this is a great way to get started. I highly recommend any of the FTM products. They have great support, the members are friendly, and you'll have cousins coming out of the woodwork!",0
"Teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is back and better than ever in her latest case, Danger on Deception Island. This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.
Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.
 Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.
As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive! (Nancys next mystery is Secret of Shadow Ranch.)",0

"This is my initial take on this edition of Cyber Link Photo Director 7 Ultra, to satisfy the needs required by Amazon Vine.

I have thus far only installed this on my Windows 8.1 laptop computer. I have a Windows 10 driven computer coming and will update the review upon installing it on that desktop. I also will install this on my Mac Mini, version 2011, as soon as I finish installing the new operating system upgrade.

At present, though, I am going to report my first impressions of my experience on the laptop.

Long ago, Adobe Photoshop leap-frogged me so badly that I am unable to justify the expenditure for their premier photo editing software. If I were seriously involved in publishing, though, I would be staying with them.

I have used their Photoshop Elements, though, and find it to be a good program for the hobbyist, as is Corel's version. Cyber Link's Photo Director 7 Ultra, though, seems to me to be a cut above the above alternatives, and worth every penny. Organizing the photographs is an item I am still playing with.

Bear in mind, I'm not interested in many features, such as editing out people or objects to make for a cleaner view. In that sense, I'm more of a purist, interested in improving upon the view, but not in so dressing up the picture to satisfy or stun my audience. What I mean is, I am more of a photo journalist than an artist.

At a future point I will describe the great features of the organizing feature, as well as it's weaknesses. Also, I will give the free mobile app a try, this week, and report on those results.

If you already have good photo editing software that you're happy with, this may still be a nice addition to your options. But, if you have no acceptable photo editing application, by all means, this is worth every penny, and works on Windows 10 very well. More on Macintosh later.",0

"When I saw Quicken WillMaker 2013 I didn't know everything that was involved with estate planning. That's where the plus comes in. With WillMaker I was able to create many documents that will help before I move on from this life. These include my living will, heath-care directive, and limited power of attorney.

I have to admit that it took a while for me to get around to creating a will and doing estate planning. I guess it just made that reality of life a little too real to me. When I did WillMaker plus made the process easier than I expected. It was effectively painless.

I didn't use the support - but other reviews provide glowing reviews which I suspect are founded based on the well thought-out software.

This is a good DIY tool for straightforward estate planning: probably 90+ percent of estates. It probably gets a good start on much more complicated planning that will requires a visit to legal office. The head start that WillMaker Plus could provide in paperwork and organization may save hundreds or thousands in legal fees compared to going in with nothing.",0
This product is MUCH improved over previous versions.  It just works without getting in the way.  Check my review history because with prior versions I was no fan.  Now I am.,0

"This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon. This Gigabit switch (and it's larger ProSafe Plus kin) has port mirroring and other advanced functions for comprehensive service quality, diagnosing, and monitoring of network traffic on-the-cheap. It's impossible to find this stuff in the average, everyday un-managed switches at the lower end of the price pool where this one also swims.

To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0

"For months Ive been plagued by Adware that I could not figure where it was coming from. Norton 360 Premier was also unable to find it. Kaspersky Internet Security found the two Adware rascals on the first scan and removed them. All I can say is Kill, Kill, Kill stupid Adware, Yehaa. OK that was childish, but I was happy to get rid of the Adware Ive spent several hours trying to identify over the last few months. I should say that Ive identified and removed Adware and viruses that AV software did not find before. It can be done but not always.

I got the Kaspersky Internet Security just in time for my Norton 360 Premier to expire. I've used a lot of different AV software including various editions of Kaspersky, ESET, Trend Micro, Webroot, Norton, BitDefender, McAfee, AVG, MalwareBytes, etc. My overall impression is that in general ESET, Norton/Symantec, and Kaspersky are the most effective. However, Norton is very intrusive and Ive had issues with Norton slowing things down. My impression is also backed up studies made by the Anti-Virus Bulletin Board. My favorite AV software is probably ESET, it is extremely effective, but ESET NOD32 version 5 was messing up Microsoft Outlook 2013 because of some faulty COM components. Since Ive only had good experience with this Kaspersky Internet Security it is pretty close to being my favorite.

Installing Kaspersky Internet Security was fairly straightforward but I had to uninstall Norton 360 and I not fond of having to type in the Activation code after installation. I know it is a common practice, but how about checking that code is valid before you install so you don't have to go through an uninstall if it fails. A full scan takes a long time but it is very effective. ESET has the same problem, but there is a reason why they are the best ones in finding malware.

Kaspersky Internet Security has a lot of interesting features including the Secure Keyboard, Safe Money, and parental control. Even though I don't use these features very often these features is a plus. The GUI is nice looking, streamlined and very easy to use. Kaspersky remains one of my favorite AV software apps.",0
"I have Trend Micro's Internet Security on one computer at home and Bit Defender on another.  I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  I knew Trend Micro from 8 or 9 years ago when I got to know it as a free online system scanner.  I used it several times to rid myself of pesky viruses that McAfee could not deal with.

The specific thing I like about the Trend Micro is that it really doesn't slow the system down at all, while providing apparently great protection (I've had no virus problems that I'm aware of).  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  But the Trend Micro has been almost invisible.

I have been very happy with the feature whereby it clears out the malicious cookies that are downloaded onto my computer through surfing the Internet.  Each day it deletes spybots and data miners without my prompting it.

If you are looking for a very fine internet security program I can definitely recommend this one.  My assessment is based on only one month of use, but that has been a completely incident free month.",0

"This is my 22nd consecutive year to buy TurboTax.  There really is no other option for me.  My only decision is when to buy.  Amazon did the same thing this year that they did last year......they hooked up an extra 10% on your tax rebate from Uncle Sam if you convert it into an Amazon gift card.  Let's just say the extra 10% on my rebate paid for the cost of the TurboTax plus some last year.  Hope I can repeat this year.

This is a win-win for anyone buying it.  I can't believe I used to slog thru IRS pub after IRS pub and still never really get it.  Never, ever again.

Update 12/14/2014
""Spaceman"" pointed out (see comments) that I was kinda wrong.  If you look at what I said, I made no comment about the Deluxe TurboTax NOT having all the same features it had last year.  I was only commenting about the 10% off and that TurboTax does 90% of the legwork for me.  If I would have given a totally complete review, I should have pointed out the change.  Why didn't I do that?  I didn't know.  Spaceman pointed out how stupid I was.  OK, got me.  Sorry.  I have researched with TurboTax FAQs and I will have to pay the difference between what I paid for Deluxe and what TurboTax sells the Premier for when I get to that point in February 2015.  I still would not change my comments, although they will be attached to the Premier version next year.  I am sorry if I mislead anyone.  I do love TurboTax, even though it looks like they have forced a lot of us to go the Premier version.  Hey, that's life.  Do you pay the same amount for burger that you did in the 80s.  I doubt it.  If you don't want to pay for a product that rocks, then don't.  I am just saying that TurboTax has made my life a little easier by crunching all the numbers so I don't have to.  I would pay twice what I do.  I would.  Have fun with your taxes.

Update 12/15/2014
More comments.  I think that is great.  Just a note.  I paid $50, not the $40 that I see it on Amazon currently.  I still think I got a good deal at $50.  Everyone NEEDS to know that you may have to go to a Premier to do the same things you did last year.  Heck, I think most of us forget we used to be able to use Basic for most of our taxes.  I could.  How many lines of Tax Code have the idiots in DC written into law in the last 20 years.  Lots.  I don't want to ever slug thru IRS Pubs again.  If you don't buy TurboTax, buy something.  It is too complicated to do it on your own.....without help.

Update 2/2/2015
I don't know about all of you, but I got an email from a General Manager of TurboTax.  Seems after I upgrade and file, I go to a TurboTax directed site and get $25 back.  I think my upgrade is $30, so I will only be $5 out of pocket.  Then next year's taxes I will need Premier.  All good here.

Update 2/9/2015
Per emails from TurboTax, 7 Feb was a new shift.  I logged on on 7 Feb, and when I got to the part that I needed to upgrade to Premier.....the cost was ZERO.  I want to thank all the screamers out there who complained, but I never had any doubt that TurboTax would fix it.  I have been a loyal member since 1992, and over the years they have made some bonehead mistakes.  You know what?  Every single time they have fixed them.  Every single one.  So, I was not concerned in the least.  This is a company that wants to make money, unlike the Federal Government that just wants to take more and give less.  Bottomline, I have not paid one extra dime this season. Thanks TurboTax.",0
"I read all of the Nancy Drew books when I was a kid, so I was intrigued when I saw that there are now computer games based on the books.  Although I'm now 35, I decided to purchase a few and see how I liked them (I figured that if they were too ""childish"" for me, I could always give them to my niece...).  However, that was not to happen, as I absolutely love playing them!

One of the best features of these games is that there's several levels to choose from - beginner to expert - and this will allow you to decide just how hard you want the game to be.  The difference between the levels is the number & type of hints you get along the way.

This particular game is one of my favorites.  It was actually quite difficult, and so I found it to be a wonderful challenge.  The graphics are excellent, and you really get that mysterious feeling as you traverse this old, spooky castle.

If you liked reading Nancy Drew, you'll absolutely love playing these games!  They are great for kids and adults alike.  However, regardless of your age, if you haven't played too many Nancy Drew games, I'd recommend that you go with the beginner level for this game - if not, you may get frustrated quite easily.",0

"I've never used any budgeting software before and this was a real eye opener for me. I can import or connect to all my banking paypal credit cards, you name it and see exactly where all the income and expenses are. To tell the truth - it made me realize what an idiot I've been (possibly) spending as much as I have on things of possible useless value. So far it hasn't really helped me reform immensely but somewhat I think. I'm still spending but maybe not quite as much weaning myself from it so to speak.

This software is worth every penny. Wish I'd had it 20 years ago !

Everyone should have this - everyone !

I don't know why there were negative reviews here. This is also good for small business to see if you're making a profit. Boy is this stuff good !

It is a little hard to figure things out exactly - for that you'd probably need peachtree accounting but who has the time to put all that data in there - not me. This isn't as exact but then it only takes a few hours, and that's probably all the time I have, what with a family, a job, and a small business (in which I am losing my shirt, I now realize, possibly).

"I love trend products, and this one is no exception.  They work, they make sense, they don't do weird things, and they don't inexplicably crash over and over.  The protection is apparently good too--I've never been infected when using Trend, which I can't say about the 2 big names...you know the ones they stick you with ""trial versions"" of when you buy your new computers?

Trend products are really rock solid, and I swear by them.  This is the same thing I recommended for my mother, who isn't tech-savvy at all, as well as any friends who are shopping for AV & antispyware products.  Trend is the name you want to see on YOUR computer.

AV software is supposed to work in the background, with minimal user input.  It's supposed to protect my computer, 24 hours a day, each and every day, without crashing or conflicting with my OS or other software.  I don't want to have a personal relationship with my AV software...I just want it to WORK.  I also don't want it to fail because someone hits a key allowing my computer to be infected with crap, so it has to be efficient without continual input from me or anyone walking by my computer.  Trend delivers, and I swear by it.",0

This year's product is much easier to edit than previous years. Override is also easier. Editing a form is very convenient. TurboTax has always been easy to use. It audits your return and compares your return with other U.S. averages. It allows you to file electronically (for a small fee).,0
"on the life-cycle of this item & the other vista versions aswell & if ur one of the xp users out there who have been afraid to upgrade to windows 7 or 8, then this item is for u.., u'll need service packs 1 & 2 for this item after installing it & some versions alredy include sp1 & if u get a version with sp1 included - then u'll only need to download & install sp2, - but its comparable to windows 7 & it'll give a person the chance to get the feel of a newer operating system before upgrading to 7 or 8.., - just make sure u get a sealed copy before purchasing - if the description on isn't clear about it being a sealed copy or not - then ask the seller to be sure before buying ! ..

 NOTE: lately i've seen some copies of this software thats marked "" OPEN BOX ""  & sometimes that just means that its been opened for display only & it can still be activated after its been installed,  ASK THE SELLER if thats the case before buying cuz if is the case - then u can still get a good price on an open-box item if the software hasn't been activated & the key is still included  - BUT other times the keys to those packages have been lost & they cant be used again - even if someone says u can buy a new vista key,  microsoft no-longer sells new keys for vista to the best of my knoledge - just do the research by asking the seller ! ..",0

"I've used TaxCut every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I repeated this experiment this year. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

TaxCut software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

H&R Block tax software does a good job despite having a few flaws, my two pain complaints:

1. My annual pet peeve: foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040 is not done automatically, it require entering data manually. This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year, but not it is not clear to me why the program cannot do the right thing.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and printscreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing sofware which I can print or save for later.

In addition to tax software, the package includes DeductionPro software. I find it helpful in organizing and valuating charity donations, such as clothing and household items.

The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful. Despite a few annoyances, it does a good job.",0
"This software does not change much from year to year. The reason we keep buying it is that the ""online"" features expire after three years. Personally I am quite comfortable with this arrangement. This year's model has a few bug fixes and a maybe two new features. You can see for yourself at Intuit's web site, there is not much. I found the upgrade installation to be perfect: no issues, no lost data, and reasonably quick.

There is already an update available from Intuit. The normal way to get updates is through the program itself, but this failed for me, repeatedly. I went to the Intuit web pile and downloaded the ""mondo patch."" Installing that was easy.

This is simply the best software of its kind available. Since Microsoft Money crapped out, there is no other software product that even comes close, in terms of features or usability. In my use, it is stable and dependable.

You should be aware that Intuit has put this product up for sale. No one seems to know what entity will take over the Quicken product line. Therefore, it is not possible to know how well the program will be maintained in the years to come.

Of particular interest is Quicken's ""one step update"" feature. Using this feature, you can download your banking and brokerage transactions directly into Quicken. I find this feature to be essential. It is by far the best method for detecting attacks on your accounts that are exposed to the internet. This feature isn't about software or technology. It is all about the business relationships that Intuit has built up over the years; with financial institutions all over North America and beyond. I am concerned about the future of these relationships.

I believe that anyone with either a family or a decent income should use Quicken. Spending and saving your money involves decisions every day. It is better to drive those decisions with data than to rely solely on your instincts. In spite of the uncertainty about Quicken's future, I would recommend it without reservation. I bought my 2016 copy soon after it went on sale here.

The modern alternative to Quicken is a fully web-based, free service such as Mint. You get what you pay for. You give away your privacy too.

Me, I will stick with Quicken as long as it is available. I back up my home computer frequently. My financial data is private and secure, living on my home disk drive and my encrypted backup drives.",0

"I installed Trend Micro AntiVirus plus AntiSpyware on a brand new computer with Windows Vista, the installation was simple and the only thing needed was an update.  The program integrated straight into Vista and auto configured without me having to make any adjustments.

One of the issues I have is that despite Viruses and Spyware being a real threat, when you buy a new computer you don't get any really powerful programs to stop them.  Windows Defender works to a certain level but when you use a good program then you realize it is limited.

I like this software by Trend Micro, it isn't over the top with unnecessary buttons, and the interface is simply and easy to use.  It runs seamlessly in the background and you wouldn't even know it was there until it pops up occasionally to let you know if there is a problem.  You can set the parameters on how you want the program to run or just let it run as already configured.  You have the choice on whether to do a scan right away or let it do it automatically at a certain time.

As far as effectiveness, since 08/03/2009, the program has intercepted 41 threats.  Admittedly these were low level and internet cookies but it still reflects that the program is functioning to a good level.  This software also protects your computer from any potential threats by protecting your files and not allowing any changes without your permission.  I would highly rate this and it is one of the better Anti Virus/Spyware programs I have used.",0

It does take a little getting used to especially with punctuation but the system is very smart and does not require you to talk like a robot. As long as you enunciate the words reasonably well 99% of the time it will recognize the word correctly.

This is still the first day I'm trying this and I am very impressed and highly recommend this.",0
"The hot button in Amazon to Office.com was a dead end, but once I navigated around a little I was able to get in.  The download version requires that you create a Microsoft account if you do not have one already.  Once in, my download was there waiting for me.  Microsoft says that the download takes from 13 to 90 minutes.  Mine downloaded and installed in less than 7 minutes and was operational even before the installation was completed.  Reading other reviews, I can understand how a person might get a bit lost trying to navigate the sign-in and download protocol.  However, if you are even a little intuitive, it is not that difficult.  Amazon provides a product key#, but Office.com does not require it. I saved it anyway.  Overall, it was a positive experience.

I do have one suggestion.  In order to avoid possible frustration, if you are running Windows 8.1 and IE 11, go into ""manage add-ons"" and disable Shockwave Flash Object before you start the download.  Shockwave has some glitches that causes IE 11 to stop working at unexpected times.  Knowing this, I disabled it before I attempted the download.  Shockwave causes some many freezes, why risk it?",0

"I have used McAfee virus protection for many years and it has always worked well for me. One problem has always been the multiple accounts that spring up when we purchase new laptops or desktops. Customer service straightens them out when you ask, but it's a bother. This single yearly subscription is a great solution. The box contains a wallet-sized card with a serial number on it and a larger card with directions in English on one side and French on the other directing you to an activation site. When you go to the site and enter the serial number, you are directed to input your account information or to create an account. It's very easy. The next step takes your computer a while (depending on the speed of your connection), but you can work while the program files are downloading. (It took about an hour on my slow DSL connection.) The installation on my Windows 7 computer was seamless. To install the program on other devices, including MACs, additional PCs, laptops, and mobile devices, you just open a provided McAfee email on the device and download the software.

"When Mac OS X was first launched last year, it was a work in process.  Facing increasing pressure to get ""something"" out the door, and having gone through several failed attempts to unleash a modern operating system to replace the aging, original Macintosh operating system, Apple threw OS X (10.0) at dedicated Mac users as, essentially, a pay-to-play beta test.  Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.  At lease Apple was kind enough to tell people that 10.0 was not for everyone and was going to be revised substantially.
Then came 10.1 (now at version 10.1.5).  It improved the speed and features of 10.0 and made it ready for universal adoption.
OS X 10.2 completes the cycle.  OS X has now been optimized.  It's fast, elegant, and groundbreaking.  It has been radically improved to work seamlessly with Windows computers and Windows networks.  It has built in, easy to use Bluetooth support.  Over all, it has about 150 additions and improvements.  There is no doubt that it is now the most sophisticated, stable, and appealling operating system out there.  With its UNIX core, it appeals to techies, too.

"Back about a million years ago, when I operated businesses with around 50 employees and hundreds of products. I would have drooled over a product as capable as QuickBooks at this low a price. I bought an IBM System 36 for more than a hundred thousand 1980s dollars and spent tens of thousands more on accounting software that didn't hold a candle to QuickBooks Premier. Heck, my super-expensive software wouldn't even do payroll: had to use an outside service for that.

 Today I operate as a one-man consultancy. I have no products to inventory, no employees to account for: I have none of the problems and challenges QuickBooks was made to address.

 Frankly, I'm sorry that I don't. I'm a data junky and I love all the reports QuickBooks can produce. But for my little business, the simple Schedule C produced by Intuit's junior product, Quicken Home & Business does just fine.

 Because my work as a forensics expert requires that I know about many, many aspects of technology, I do a lot of product testing, including in this instance, QuickBooks. Installation  is straight-forward. But the learning curve is steep. Fortunately there are many books, videos, trainers, articles and consultants to help you find your way.

 Overall, QuickBooks has developed a massive franchise because it works. It may not be without problems, but it works and is a far better value than the software that coast me tens of thousands of dollars to do less years back.

"This is a great program for someone who wants to learn Italian (I also have the Spanish version).  It's really user friendly and easy to understand.  You get a software CD, DVD, and an MP3 CD you can listen, so you can pretty  much learn anywhere, in front of your computer, watching TV, taking a walk with your Ipod, in the car . . .

The program offers three different levels to learn, you can advance at your own speed.

Though I've not used the Rosetta Stone programs, I imagine this is as comprehensive for a fraction of the price.  I bought the Spanish version for my daughter because she was taking Spanish class at school.  It really helped.

"This modem works with Linux, at least the distros that I've been experimenting with (not Ubuntu, which I gave up on a long time ago so I didn't test this modem with Ubuntu, but rather some of the other Linux versions). I haven't tried all the fancy features of the modem (fax, etc) because I don't need that stuff, but dial-up works. I had some problems getting the modem's speaker to be silent, but I think that's probably an issue with my Linux software, and probably not a problem with the modem itself. Given my earlier frustrations with so-called ""WinModems"", I'm just happy to finally have this Zoom modem that actually works.",0
"I'm very happy with Quicken 2012. The layout is good and easy to understand. Tips and tutorials are helpful. Downloading transactions from my bank is easy. I like the reports, the way the pie charts and other charts are so helpful in seeing where your money is going. This is my first update in several years. There have definitely been a lot of improvements and enhanced features.",0
"I bought 2015 Premier to continue use of One Step Update functionality (my 2012 Premier One Step would become non-functional after April 2015),  2015 Premier installation was smooth without problems, it converted my QP2012 Portfolio data sets to QP2015 format (after first auto-saving my existing QP2012 data sets in a separate folder). The only somewhat annoying step was that I had to ""register"" with a Quicken User Name and password, etc. individually when converting each QP2012 portfolio to QP2015 format - that is, it doesn't provide a global ""registration"" applicable to all portfolios. All portfolios were converted correctly and all existing username+password settings for each One Step Update account were preserved.

I don't recall seeing in QP2012, but Q2015 does have useful reports for investment asset allocations.  It also provides an investment ""X-Ray"" feature to capture Morningstar info for investment (however, I haven't used that feature so I can't comment on it further).

Overall, QP2015 (like QP2012 before it, from my experience) is a terrific product.  Easy to use, easy to update transaction data (either manually or via One Step (once you've setup access with your financial institutions), and provides useful pre-configured (and customizable) investment & tax reports.  I highly recommend this product.",0
"What's not to love about a plug-n-play little hockey puck which solves so many of my connectivity problems.  My Mac G4 MDD is notorious for having too few USB and Firewire connections, and a power supply which is a bit week for daisy chained devices.  This powered hub solved my problems and it was a simple as, open the box, hook it up, turn it on, and start using it.",0
"I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 7. When Corel first bought it from it's shareware creators, they began to dumb it down and it really lost a great deal of its following. Fortunately, they left most of the power under the hood and those features that had been dumbed out of the menus, were still accessible for power users.

I've since upgraded to PSPX and PSP 14, so I am very familiar with the program. Lets start with the inevitable comparison to photoshop. Paint Shop Pro can do,  and has been able to do, 95%+ of what Photoshop as been able to do all along... Layers, yep had them forever, curves, yep... Color enhancement, easy one fixes and removing objects, they are all there. White balance correction, yep - in several places actually. It can read raw files from most major camera makers and will save to any format you can imagine. It can remove objects, repair old photos, make new photos look old, add frames, upload to Flickr, facebook, photobucket, etc... It really does it al.

Paint Shop Pro is powerful enough for anyone, even the snide, presumptuous photo editors that would have you believe that if your photo editing package didn't cost $500 then it isn't worth looking at... Pure elitist hogwash.

ANYTHING that you want to do with a photo can be done with this program.

So why isn't it more widely accepted?

Well, the industry likes a standard and photoshop was the standard back when PSP was still a $79 shareware program. So Photoshop became the standard. And once you learn the way a program works, you don't want to have to relearn the way another program works. Often it is as simple as which key combinations you have to press. Once you have mastered one program, you don't want to have to go back and relearn how to accomplish the same thing in another program.

There is one other big difference. Photoshop has always been far ahead of Paint Shop Pro in standardizing what colors you see on a photo no matter what monitor or computer you are using to view the photo. PSP only recently started trying to make this a priority.

For someone sending their work to LIFE magazine, this is important. For someone sending photos to Walgreens.com or making a shutterfly book for family and friends, it is not. All of the photo printers have software that corrects that sort of thing.

In the end it is fairly simple. If you need photoshop, get it. You will KNOW if you NEED it. If you aren't sure, then you don't need Photoshop. If you think you need PhotoShop, you probably DON'T need it. If $500 is chump change to you, then go ahead and get photoshop. If you make a living sending photos to major publications, get photoshop.

On the other hand, if $500 is a lot of money to you, get Paint Shop Pro. It is a super powerful photo editing program that has the power of photoshop under the hood, but with the ease of use that you would expect from a much less powerful program. You truly get the best of both worlds with Paint Shop Pro!

Low price, ease of use and many automated picture fixing options, yet you also have the power of layers, curves and white balancing no so much more if you are willing to learn how to use them. This is truly a bargain priced program that does virtually everything PS does (and some things it does better) at a fraction of the cost.",0
"A great antivirus tool! I used Zone for many years, it would bog my computer to a slow pace when it would scan whatever I was doing. Not so with Kaspersky, it zips along scanning in the background yet allowing me to continue a a fast pace. It has all the bells and whistles as advertised. It went in very smoothly and had no problems installing it, understanding what it told me, and gives me a lot of control over my computers every move. I would recommend over any other on the market now.",0

"I decided to primarily run on a single Apple MacBook Pro computer and I needed a solution that would allow me to still run Windows Programs on occasion.

The solution I chose was to purchase Parallels and this version of Windows 7. Of all the versions of Windows, Windows 7 is considered one of the best releases of Windows for PCs. This software easily installed under Parallels and I have never had a compatibility problem running any of my PC apps in that environment.

I know that it is possible to move the Parallels based Windows environment to a new Mac when upgrading to a new Mac machine. Therefore, I will be able to prolong the life of my Windows 7 environment beyond a single machine.

I recently upgraded from Parallels 8 on Mountain Lion to Parallels 10 on Yosemite and there were no problems. You first upgrade Parallels then you upgrade to Yosemite. It was quick, simple and did not break anything in my Windows 7 environment.

These two products work really well together and this is a great choice over other versions of Windows.",0

"I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented.  An attempt is made to segregate it, but if you watch any of the company's videos, you'll see there's an overwhelming amount of data.  It's all good mind, you and it's easy to get lost looking at pictures, seeing videos, watching trails.

It's a superb product, but I can easily see where some people might get overwhelmed.  Still, if you dive into it, you're gonna experience the Bible in a completely new way.  Not that this product is changing the word of God, but just presenting it in a new fashion.  In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this...  It's kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist.

One issue though.  Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That's not too bad.  But if you want to do the ""full"" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I've installed multi disc programs before, and they haven't taken anywhere near that amount of time.  Once it was all installed, the C:\ProgramData\Glo directory on my Windows 7 machine had a total of 10.8Gb of data, and a whopping 351,892 files!  Wow.",0
Excellent incremental upgrade from X6. Noticeable performance improvements. Much more responsive.,0
"This is a preview of what I think interested buyers would like in advance.  I will follow up with a more complete review when I finish my own taxes.

I have used this program year after year, so I don't expect to find too many faults, but as I said, I will do an update.  What I should have done is wait for a better price.  I bought it at 34 dollars and change.  You can get it now for 19 dollars and change.  Tax law has changed allowing banks, businesses, etc. to wait until much later to provide your tax information therefore there really is no need to buy early.

Update:  This year's version provides for downloading tax info from many financial firms.  Most firms have established deadlines when this feature will be available.  My firm will be ready to download on February 2nd.  Of course, you always have the option to enter the info from a paper form, or using online data at the firms web site.
The tax software itself has had one update in late January and another update is scheduled for February 23rd.  Without the updating being completed (there may be more), you cannot submit your return with any confidence it is correct.  The software will tell you if another update is planned.

Update:  I downloaded data from my financial firm.  Numerous entries were created for Interest, Dividends, and Stock Sales.  It marks each entry asking you to verify each one.  All entries were accurate.  The download saved me a lot of time.

Update:  I submitted 6 returns (3 Federal and 3 State) for members of my family.  All electronically submitted returns were accepted by the IRS within 1 day.  All returns sailed through processing and refunds came very quickly as direct deposits.  The State returns cost $19.95 to submit electronically.  All Federal returns were free to submit electronically.  The software is worth every penny I paid!",0
"WinZip is the file compression software to beat.  There are certainly many other companies trying to compete with this ongoing trustworthy tool, but you will always go back to WinZip if you ever stray away.

WinZip is fast, and saves space better than ever.  It makes sending something via email much easier, for instance, audio or video files.  Less bouncing back because the file was too big.

So it covers your compression and sharing needs, but also has security features keeping your content private.  You can store files on your system with password protection, or give files to others that have the password.

There are plenty of tools on board to work with various media and file types.  You can attach your work from the program to email. You can shink or resize files before compressing, saving even more space.  And it features an easy to understand and helpful organization system that will keep track of every file and it's location.  It's much more than file compression these days, they have moved forward to utilize their product as a necessity, not only for work, but home office, and personal collections.",0

The setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly.
I have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house. The connection is stable and the speed is as advertised.
I considered Linksys and Netgear routers, but there always was some kind of problem with them.

Very easy to follow instructions if exploring on your own, and even easier if you let the software guide you. Love it and you will too!",0
"I put off trying this product for a long time since I already had Photoshop and Painter.  I didn't see the need to purchase another product when I already had the two most expensive drawing/painting programs available.  About six months ago I downloaded the trial version of Sketchbook Pro 2010 and fell in love with it! This new version adds some nice features (like layer blending modes) that enhance the software even more.

I still use Photoshop and Painter to complete my digital works--but I often start them in Sketchbook because I find it provides the closest sensation to drawing with traditional pencil and paper of any digital art program currently available.

The pencil feature creates lines that are almost identical to the lines you would get with a regular pencil.  If you have a pressure sensitive laptop or monitor (Wacom Cintiq) then the experience is almost identical to using a pencil on paper!  Download the free trial version and try it out first to see what I mean.

The interface is very basic and easy to use.  One great advantage of this program over Photoshop or Painter is that the majority of the screen is available for drawing--it is not cluttered up with menu bars and palettes!  I find this a huge plus when I am drawing on my pressure sensitive laptop that only has a 12 inch screen.  Space is less of an issue with my 22"" Cintiq.

I've seen some very impressive works that have been totally created in SketchBook but I still use Photoshop and Painter to finish my drawings/paintings  because these programs have advanced features that SketchBook Pro doesn't have (masks, adjustment layers, etc.).

Bottom line: When it comes to pure sketching--this software is my first choice! Combined with a pressure sensitive laptop or monitor--it doesn't get any more natural feeling than this!",0

"I originally used WordPerfect and migrated to MS Office due to my work environment so it's been more than a decade since I last tried Corel's alternative office suite. Amazingly, as Office has become more convoluted since the 2010 version with useless task ribbons and endless security options, WordPerfect has stepped in to fill the void where you can find many lost MS users.

WordPerfect is practically 100% compatible in file formats, has some great PDF tools and a massive library of extra software and content. Many of the features that used to be simple in Office are well implemented here - columns, tables, footers, headers and all the features you would use frequently are very obvious. A few of options are different to Office but are easy to find and understand and overall this is simple version that's very fast and stable.

Comparing Corel and Microsoft in their latest office suites, my observation would be that WordPerfect has been developed with the user in mind (and many features have clearly been UI tested) where MS has approached the problem based around what they feel the user should like, given their predisposition to Windows 8 and touchscreen interfaces. Ultimately, it's a personal preference but if you've been frustrated with newer versions of Office, the WordPerfect suite might be a welcome upgrade.",0
"Vista is indeed a revolutionary OS. The user interface was a MAJOR improvement over XP. The Game Explorer is a very nice addition for gamers. And best of all, it doesn't crash! It's just stable.

I have used Vista Business since its release in January 2007 and it has been absolutely rock solid. It's fast (faster than XP even on systems with more than 4Gbs of RAM), much more secure than XP, compatible with older software, sexy Aero effects, and boasts loads of new features and improvements. And I already mentioned the much improved interface.

Yes, it does have a few bad things. UAC is one of them, but that can be easily turned off. Slow file transfer over the network was indeed a problem early on, but was fixed even before SP1 came out. And DRM is still just as bad as in XP.

Windows 7 is coming out in a few months, but it's not out now, so Vista still holds the crown as the best Windows version out there. Actually, Windows 7 is nothing but Vista SE with a new name. I ran the Windows 7 release candidate full time for a month, and realized that I had been running ""Windows 7"" since January 2007. Heh. I will still upgrade to Win7 though, if I find it for cheap (the current upgrade prices are NOT worth it if you already own Vista).

Overall, this OS has served me well over these past three years, and just felt compelled to write a positive review. Good job Microsoft! :)",0

"Because this device is versatile and dependent on my driving, Im going to do this review in stages.

 Stage One is installation and setup  which took me just about as long as typing the first part of this sentence.

 I recommend getting setup online first. You can use a web browser or download apps for iOS and Android. I accessed it on the web using Chrome and with the Android app.

 Theres nothing to it. Just remember there is a $19.95 a month fee for accessing the system.

 The device and reporting system are clearly intended for fleet usage or high activity vehicles. The dashboard provides a variety of settings including permissible use hours, speeding alerts, driving report card and more. You can get several kinds of alerts including maintenance due notices. The entire user interface is very clean and very easy to use.

 Google maps with an enhanced user interface is always available. You can view trip history, locate the vehicle (which can be extremely useful for trouble on the road at night when you haven't been keeping track of mileposts). Fleet managers can replay the route history  as can parents monitoring and coaching their younger drivers.

 For a fleet manager, the $19.95 a month charge per vehicle could be very well worth it. For individuals, it is a judgment call, though if I had a new driver in the house, Id gladly pay it for a year or so until I was sure of their driving habits.

 Installation? If you know where your OBD port is, it takes seconds.

 Ill add when I get some miles logged with the unit.

"My brother is a home remodeler, and worked as a Real Estate broker for well over 30 years. During that time he became someone who was deeply involved in design decisions that were made before new construction started. Finally becoming a remodeler himself. It is fascinating to see his depth of knowledge transform itself on the screen. He has been using an older version of the top Chief Architect program, version 9.5 with a hefty price tag. With this newer version, albeit a junior version of their flagship product, shows many advances over the old full version of the program. He didn't need to draw up blueprints because when it got to the point that additions were being built, he would hire a licensed architect to take his plans and finalize them for approval.
When I showed him this program, in no time at all he was creating multi-room dwellings completely furnished etc. He wants to use it for his remodeling business. Bringing a finished photograph of the remodeling changes was an excellent customer exciter. He had that feature in the old program but it also included ""ray trace"" which was a photo enhancer to make photographs appear more lifelike. He was using Chief Architect 9.5 before. In addition this designer 10 does not have the same sophisticated CAD program. For example if you wanted to show the detail in the foundation, for example the size of the individual block, and components. Even with all that in mind, he loves the program for his day to day business.
Personally I found the tutorial videos very informative, and enabled me to start creating rooms, laying out the outer walls. There are a lot of automatic functions that make it easier for the novice. I am also very excited about the features included in the program including landscaping and decks. What blew my mind was the option of planting a wide array of bushes, and then with a click or two you could determine what they would look like when they were more mature. What a great way to make smart landscaping choices. The amount of detail that the landscaping function includes with all of the different plant species.
This is a great program. Download the trial version and check it out. Highly recommended.",0

"I own a prior NAS from QNAP (a TS409 purchased about 2 years ago).  I have had little to no problems with the NAS device, and when I did have 1 problem updating the firmware, QNAP tech support was top notch.  They remoted into my NAS and fixed the issue.

When I decided to purchase another NAS device (extra speed, more storage), I could not find a better product than this QNAP.  You can find CHEAPER devices from synology, or thecus, but I feel this device is one of the best.

The build quality feels excellent.  When it arrived, it feels and looks like a serious piece of IT equipment (which it is).  The front panel makes it easy to setup.

I had no issues mounting my drives (also purchased through amazon), and performing the setup.  There are a lot of options with the firmware of this device!

It can be setup to email or sms txt message you if there is a problem with it, it has several different built in software applications (like ITUNES server, and bittorrent downloading software), and is expandable with applications you can install through the firmware separately.

It IS a lot of money, and you could build a computer for less money, but at full load this device uses much less energy than a computer, is quieter, and QNAP is always updating the firmware with new features.

They even updated the firmware for my old NAS with most of the new features of the newer ones, so they do not just abandon the old devices until technology has fully passed them by.

Highly recommend this product.",0
"Funny thing about Autocad. You start out completely overwhelmed and awkward, with random things popping up at odd moments, spending a lot of time trying to figure out what the hell you just did. Over time (and I've spent a lot of time) your movements become less spastic, less awkward. You start drafting without thinking about it. One day you realize you've completely mind-melded with the program. One hand is on the stylus, the other playing chords on the  keyboard. Steam is rising from your fingertips. Blueprints and floorplans appear on screen as if by magic.

I'd never used Sketchbook before getting this version. But if I didn't know this program was made by Autodesk, I probably would have figured it out. Because it does for graphic illustration what Autocad does for drafting. Yes, you can drill down through endless menus to get to windows and functions.  But you can also click *just here* and drag *just so* and lo and behold your brush is now a marker and your stroke is now green and half-saturated and ten point. Whomp.

The tools are inspired by actual drawing tools - no splines, just a french curve (works just like the real one). No snap-to-grid, but instead orthographic projection underlays (I do wish those allowed a bit more line variation, instead of forcing the snap). The new ""flipbook"" function has no tweening, but it was clearly designed with storyboards in mind. If you have a pressure sensitive stylus, like the Wacom Intuos, you can emulate brush strokes frighteningly well. There are of course layers, and undo.

Architects who trained on Autocad cringe at the thought of using something like Illustrator for drafting. Wizard-level programmers who trained on Emacs would rather eat their own liver than use Word. I have no doubt there are graphic artists who feel the same way about Sketchbook.",0

Of course, once the router arrived, it was a snap to setup the network, since Windows 7 had no problems finding the adapter and router.

"Viruses are a real computer threat and after one wiped my computer I refused to have that happen again. I got a new computer and I ordered Norton Internet Security for my new Mac.  I didn't want anything happening to this huge investment, so far so good, fingers crossed for longer.",0
"About six years ago I went to a tax adviser, sat there with my files, and answered all their questions while they typed the information into a form on their computer.  I then paid them $150.  Afterwards, I thought to myself, ""I can do that.""  I've tried both TurboTax and H&R Block, and am a full fledged fan of H&R Block.

Why?  This past year 2013 is really what sold me.  My taxes were a little more complex than usual due to some stock options I exercised.  I decided to try their online assistance.  It took about ten minutes for me to connect (this was mid-March), and once I did the agent on the other end was extremely helpful and patient.  I even commented during our online chat session that due to my circumstances, I should probably go and see a consultant in person.  The response was something along the lines of ""you're welcome to do that and I can show you how to contact an H&R Block representative in your area, but I'm sure I can help you here...""  And, they were absolutely correct.  My questions were answered and my concerns were resolved.  All of this was via an easy click on a link from the software.

The questions are straight forward as you fill out the forms, and the process is very easy.  I get a fairly good comfort level when using this software for my taxes...I just don't see the need to make a switch.  Great service, great support if you need it, and much cheaper and more convenient than going to someone's office.",0

"Ive used Turbo Tax for the 3 previous years & will use it this year as well. I don't have alot of deductions, or any children & Im single but I 'aint' the sharpest knife in the drawer & Im kinda math stupid. So in the past Ive always be a little apprehensive when I mail my returns.

I also moved 3 years ago from a state with no state taxes to a state that does collect taxes. Alot of taxes! That along with the fact that Im making more money (curse this G.W.Bush economy!) & have a larger 401K, a substantial high interest savings account & a another investment on the side, I feel the need to get the most I can out of my taxes & reporting of same.

My taxes are fairly straight forward ( I think!? ) & with some effort I could go back to doing them again. But I have made mistakes doing my taxes  in the past & Turbo Tax ( so far ) has not. I feel confidant using Turbo Tax & that alone is worth the price of admission.

As far as the e filing, I don't use it. Thankfully, Im in a position where I can wait for my check. If I got it right away it wouldnt make any difference in my quality of life so the expense is just a waste for me.

Also, I didn't read it here but while at Staples last night I saw something about getting a free year of credit monitoring from Experian when you purchase the deluxe model. NOW, how much would you pay!? ;P",0

"This installs easily and has a backup service. The software covers ten devices.

I get annoyed that this is really a one year subscription, but it works well, and it also is the best choice antivirus  required to interface with my work computer, from a short list.

The software will cover smartphones and tablets. Installation is easier now that there is an email-directed installation protocol. I installed this on my smartphone in minutes. I sent my email address FROM my phone TO the Norton site (there is a place under your account that says ""add a device"") and I had it up and running in no time.

This software is not 100% proof against all malware--last year, I did get an infection from a very clever piece of malware that used a trick to get installed and the previous edition of the software did not recognize it as malware. I do not know if this update has improved its ability to detect everything--it's rated as very good for catching malware.",0

We've used Word Perfect since its very beginning and cannot fully explain what a blessing it has been in our life of writing and editing. Truly the greatest invention since sliced bread. Don't turn on your computer without it. What more can we say. It is word PERFET.,0

Nice product. Easy installation. Works well for me personally. Windows has done it again.,0
"I have used Norton AntiVirus for many years now but switched to 360 last year.
The only reason I switched was because I got a $45.00 Norton/Visa Debit card with the purchase from one of the local office suppliers and I was curious.
I have been using a computer since before the commodore 64 days. (We engineers put them together from scratch in the late 70's)
I don't need Parental controls, Backup, Identity control (I question the reality of this one), or PC tuneup, as some of these functions can be done through windows.
A lot of the above 360 functions are nothing more than a pain in the rump!
Don't get me wrong, I like Peter Norton's stuff; his book PC-DOS (1985) helped more than any other to get me trained in the new floppy (No windows) world.
If you have lots of money to throw away, or feel that you need the parental controls, then the 360 may be the way to go.
If all you want is Antivirus protection, then this is your software.",0
"Great idea.  Items arrived ahead of schedule.

"...and all I can base my review on is my own experience with the product. Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

If you're a tax-time procrastinator: April is right around the corner. Now is the time to select with confidence.",0
"This is so worth the cost. I am a professional I.T. consultant with over 25 years experience I and cannot tell you how many times I have had to clean up a mess left behind by the free AND pay versions of anti-virus applications such as AVG.  Norton Security has a very minimal impact on day-to-day performance of most PCs, works great with Windows 7, 8, and 10, and can even be installed on Android devices.  I love it and highly recommend it.
Note that you WILL have to pay a yearly subscriber fee.",0
"I have been using this product since its early releases (purchased this version as an upgrade through Acronis). This backup software got me out of trouble a few times including one incident which my PC's hard drive completely crashed. I was able to recover all my backup data and got my computer going again within 1-2 days. It took about 4 hours on the average to backup 250 Gbytes of data with the verify option turned on.

I also used this software to expand my laptop hard drive capacity using the cloning feature. So far I have cloned three of my laptops' hard drives to the higher capacity 500 GB drives without any problems. It is quite useful particularly with the low hard disk drives cost nowadays.

Another beauty of this backup software is that it allows you to browse the contents of the  backup file with a windows explorer like interface and selectively restore the files without have to manually launch the recovery option from the menu. If you register this software on the Acronis product website, you would also be able to download the latest updates of the same version (fully installable file, not patches) for free by logging in your account.",0
"I gave this a ""1"" this year because the CD just plain flat out didn't work. I tried mutliple PCs, all with the same resul ... ""Please insert a CD"". Dummy me didn't try the CD until the 30 day return policy had expired, so there was no way to return it for a refund. I called Intuit and luckily they provided me with a downloadable copy via their site. Intuit seemed pretty aware of the problem, as they didn't even request the CD be sent to them. I should get a refund for all the hassle I went through!!  ha ha",1
"I have taken a number of classes to learn a variety of languages (French formal classes, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic to name a few), and have forgotten most of them all. Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.

Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.

While the process has been much quicker, more of a review, than with the Spanish version, I have followed the lesson plans to get a true feel for the software. Learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.

My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Paris. P-)",0
"I've been using TurboTax for many years now, and have always been pleased with its easy interface and final results. This 2011 tax year version installed fast and without any hiccups, and found the previous year's info very quickly and made my info startup a breeze. Now I have to wait for everybody to send me my yearly statements for me to enter the info. One year, after doing my taxes on TurboTax, I brought all my info to a local (not a chain) tax preparer, and his results came out the same as TurboTax, which amazed me completely. He asked me the same questions as Turbo did (he probably used the professional version of TurboTax.

"Over the years, I have used any number of photo editing and graphics programs, ranging from Adobe PhotoShop to CorelDraw to PaintShop Pro.  However, I've never used anything quite like Painter Essentials 5.

This program is designed to help you convert your photographs into art.  It has a number of tools that will let you paint using your photographs as a jumping off point.  It also has filters and algorithms that will automatically convert your photographs into pre-selected styles (e.g., watercolor).  The program gives you controls of numerous parameters and is quite powerful for the price.

I have toyed around with it using a mouse and also a Bamboo pad and pen.  Both work well.  You don't have to be a whiz to get in and start fooling around.  However, if you want to do anything serious with this program, prepare to spend some time learning its process.  The online help isn't bad, but to get the most out of this you'll have to spend some time with it.

It installed and ran like a breeze on an Intel i7-3770K machine I built a few years ago, running Windows 8.1 with 16gb of RAM and a decent AMD video card.  The controls were smooth and responsive.

If you have a yen to make painterly scenes or portraits from your photographs, this is a powerful program that will let you do it.  Just be ready to invest time learning how to get the most out of it.",0
"Please note that I am by no means an authority on software of any variety. That being said, from the perspective of a layperson, this version of Trend Micro's security software appears to be doing a sufficient job protecting me and my computer from our respective selves. The first point to mention is that setup is extremely user friendly, even with regard to some of the specific software settings. At this point I have probably meddled with the configurations as much as I ever will, as I have only utilized this product on my home PC. Nonetheless, I have taken further steps customizing my security settings than I have ever done previously simply because of this software's ease of use and thorough, yet simple, explanation of available functions. One such customization option that I have now utilized for the first time on any security software is the parental control/web browser settings. The ability to restrict specific categories of information, images, and data, as well as descriptions of each category, allows one to feel confident in what they are blocking and what they are allowing on a user specific basis.

Beyond the actual customizable functions, almost everyone probably has the same question: will this security software slow everything on my computer to a screeching halt? After a little use, it seems that this particular software has not had the same ridiculous stopping power of other security platforms that I have utilized in the past. That is, as of this moment, I am pleased with my ability to utilize this software as the issuing company recommends while continuing the use of any other applications simultaneously. All in all, I am not disappointed and, perhaps, pleased (if such a thing is possible when dealing with PC/Internet security software).",0

It is both easy and fun to use--yet it contains a wealth of advance features that will enable you to create complex drawings and paintings. I've included a video to show some of the features of this program.

I've also created review videos of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-13/dp/B00NNZNTAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 13</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Painter-2015/dp/B00LYYMXF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Painter 2015</a>&nbsp;so you could view those to see how those programs compare to Sketchbook. Hopefully this will enable you to select the best software depending on what you want to do!

One of the main reasons why I like Sketchook Pro for drawing is that the pencil tool provides the closest sensation to sketching with traditional pencil and paper of any software program that I've used. Combine Sketchbook Pro 7 with a pressure sensitive laptop, tablet, or Wacom Cintiq monitor and the experience is very similar to using a pencil on paper.

Another major reason I like Sketchbook is the simplicity of the interface.  The workspace is not filled up with menu bars and palettes. If you are using a small monitor, laptop, or tablet you will really appreciate this feature.

Here is a list of other features that I really like.

1. The variety of brushes, pencils, markers, etc. and the ability to change the brushes and create your own.

2. This is an easy program to learn--at least the basics.  It does have advanced features--but you can create a lot of good drawings or paintings by just knowing the basics.

3. The Symmetry feature--I like drawing faces and this makes it really easy. A NEW feature of Sketchbook Pro 7 is you can reposition the Symmetry axis to different parts of your image.  Basically you can use it to create an object in one part of your image and then drag it to a new part and use it there.

4. The NEW Perspective Guide feature.  This is going to make drawing in perspective a LOT easier!

5. The NEW layer features including Background Color Layer and the ability to use Layer Groups.

6. The NEW flip book animation feature looks great--I just need more time to try it out!

There are also several other new features of Sketchbook Pro 7 that I believe will be very useful. They include the Glow and Soft Glow blend modes, the ability to distort and transform selections and layers, and the new Gradient Fill feature.

There is a great online manual that can be accessed by clicking on the ""Help"" link on the menu bar.  I created a short video segment on this but I had to remove it to keep the video under 10 minutes.  The manual includes very good directions on how to use the various features.  It can be downloaded and saved on your computer.

My usual workflow is to start out a sketch in Sketchbook Pro and then I bring it into Photoshop or Painter to finish it. Sketchbook Pro does include all the features necessary to start and complete a drawing or image--and I've seen some wonderful images done completely with Sketchbook Pro--but Photoshop and Painter still have advanced features that I've grown accustomed to using.

Bottom line: When it comes to pure sketching--Sketchbook Pro 7 is my first choice.  Combined with a pressure sensitive tablet or monitor it doesn't get any more natural feeling than this.",0

"Pinnacle Studio 19 Plus is  good mid-level video editing software. Its price point and functionality are targeted towards the beginner-intermediate editor, and it works reliably, has powerful editing capabilities, and import/export functionality. I run it on a Windows 10 computer (about 1.5 years old) and haven't had an issues with it. This is a solid software choice if you're looking for editing software for personal or family videos, or for basic work/technical film editing.

The learning curve is reasonable and in 1-2 hours, you can do basic editing and video composition. The more sophisticated inputs and channels will take a little longer to learn - but still approachable. The interface of the program isn't too cluttered, and common tools have shortcuts.

YouTube has been invaluable for finding tutorials on how to do different things, and I've relied on it a lot.",0

"If you are a full time, professional graphics artist you're mostly likely using Adobe products which cost many times the price of this graphics suite.  If this is how you make your living, spending a few thousand dollars for software is a no-brainer.  But what about the rest of us?

This is what I love about CorelDraw.  It gives you 90% of the power of Adobe at 10% of the price.  The interface is more intuitive and Corel does a brilliant job of making the deep feature set of this product as accessible to those of us who do graphics work on a part time basis.

The deciding factor if you make your living doing graphics is the features and CorelDraw is no slouch.  That's why many professionals prefer it over Adobe.

If graphics is a side job for you, then CorelDraw gives you all the tools you'll need, with a intuitive user interface that is much easier to understand and use.",0
"Now when it comes time to protect my PC, I like to experiment around with Antivirus/Internet Security companies. Yes I do my homework before making a purchase. Kaspersky has good rep for award winning protection. So I gave these guys a try and by far no malware! I noticed another user commented that the autorun.exe did not come up once the Installation Disc was in the computer. Its not so hard to go to My computer and click on the DVD drive then autorun.exe.. Anyways, this is my 2nd purchase from this company (Purchased the 2013 Antivirus version and it works top noch). I had to issues that the other users have experienced when downloading. My advice, check the system requirements. I noticed the updating the virus definitions can b a little slow, but I am okay with it because it because on this custom built PC by me, it does not bog down my computer on resources. I highly recommend this product not just for the looks, but for the reputation and award winning protection. Note this is a 1 year 3 PC edition, which by far is the best price I have ever seen when I was shopping around for the same product.

"I'm an artist so although I used this product extensively for a year or more, the day dawned where I needed to upgrade to the industry powerhouse of graphics' programs, Photoshop.  Photoshop is a very difficult, expensive and challenging program though and unless you are a photographer or an artist, you can probably do as well or better with Paint Shop Pro 7.  It is easier to learn and operate and does an enormous range of image editing tasks.  I've produced excellent original art work on it.  I also have edited or manipulated images with ease.  It comes in at 1/6th the cost of Photoshop and for a vast pool of users out there, it more than does the job.

"I love TurboTax. We use it to prepare our household taxes every year.

There is a table on the back of every box to help you pick which version you need. It has been accurate in my experience:

As my career progressed, I graduated to TurboTax Basic.
When I married, our combined assets bumped us into Deluxe and then Premier.
We don't own a business, so we may never need Home & Business.

Prior to this, I had never revisited Basic. I was curious to experience how much I was gaining from using Premier. Without going into too much detail, the difference is night and day. I think they sit too far apart in the gamut for an honest comparison, like comparing a Corolla to an Avalon. But it is clear that our family will never get by with Basic. Thankfully, this was provided to me free of charge under the Vine program, but otherwise, it would have been $30 wasted. I'll stick with Premier.

BOTTOM LINE: TurboTax is wonderful, but you should follow the advice on the back of the box. Don't skimp. Buy the version that's right for you. Don't be intimidated by the cost. You can write off the cost of the software as Tax Prep.",0
"Microsoft has a whole set of suites that deal with maps.  The lowest level is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2010-with-GPS/dp/B0017KEA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2010 with GPS</a>.  There are versions with GPS and others without.

Mappoint is more though, Mappoint is designed with the business user in mind.  You can integrate Mappoint with Microsoft Office and Access databases and use it to create beautiful business map graphics that are based on geography and then import them into powerpoint.  If you're a business user developing marketing plans, analyzing markets, deciding where to put your next franchise, Mappoint is a great tool to help you with that.

I have to admit that I've been a Mappoint user since the product first came out and back then it cost upwards of $1,000 but that price has been dropping.  I think this is predominantly based on competition from online cloud tools like googlemaps and mapquest.  The biggest change is that some of the buttons have been changed to give it a more user friendly look and feel to it (the layout is less cryptic than before) and it has more options for data visualization.

However, when it comes to doing business analysis, Mappoint is still a superior product because you're working with the data locally: local maps, local software, and local databases which allows you to model and run through versions much faster.  You also don't have to deal with the internet and whether the online application will be available or not.

At its current price point, I highly recommend this product for the small business or small franchise that is analysing data or for marketing professionals.  You will be rewarded with much faster performance.

INSTALLATION:
took about 7 minutes and installed fully to my machine so I don't need to keep a DVD in my machine - which is great.

COMPARISON TO GOOGLE MAPS
This does everything that google maps does but offers more customization and because it's all on your computer, it's faster and you don't have to have an internet connection.

MAPS:
The maps give you:
- regular street view
- terrain view
- night view
- political view
- and you can customize with whatever data you want to integrate with
- there is no satellite view that I could find (I'm still digging though)

STREETS AND TRIPS OR THIS
This has all the functionality of streets and trips but adds the data integration component.  If you're a business professional on the road a lot then this product can be your streets and trips (you can integrate a GPS into it) + you get the ability to integrate data into it to create your presentations without having to connect to the web.  If you're just looking for a trip planning software, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2010-with-GPS/dp/B0017KEA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2010 with GPS</a>&nbsp;which gives you standalone mapping and GPS.

ADDITIONAL MAPS
This version comes with North American detailed maps.  If you're doing business modeling for Asia, Europe, South America etc, Microsoft sells additional maps for those regions.  Visit the Microsoft site for those.  I've only ever used the US and Europe versions so beyond that can't comment.",0

"Through the last 20 years my husband and I have used a lot of office software. Right now, WordPerfect is my default, and OpenOffice is his. However, he switches to WordPerfect office for some specific things, and I don't use OpenOffice for anything, because WordPerfect does everything I need.
It saves nicely in a lot of formats and has all the applications you expect from a good office suite. It's intuitive to use, and common enough that if you do get stuck, it's easy to find a solution to the problem without having get customer support.
Where WordPerfect excels for me, and the reason my husband switches to it every so often is in straight word processing. In this, it's so much better than Microsoft Office. Most of my writing is craft instructions, and it was easy to create the various templates I wanted, and it's easy to format the documents professionally.
About PDFs- I don't use the program to make PDFs, my husband does and he's happy with the pdfs he makes using it. Generally I save in .doc format then create the pdfs using Acrobat for greater control and the ability to add in fillable text fields easily.
I still prefer the full version, because a lot of my use is commercial, and the Home and Student edition isn't meant to be used that way. However, it has the same functions, and works just as well at a lower price making it a great choice for students.",0

"I purchased this program for my new Vista PC and I was quite pleased with the new and improved features, which integrates quite well on a Vista PC. As a previous owner of Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002, I have become reliant on the program for both work and home. I elected to buy Outlook and Office Student and Home to maximize my dollar towards my Office purchase and I have no regrets. The Office Standard edition does not include One Note, which is one of those programs that integrates well with the new Outlook. In the end, I spent less and got more.

I would not recommend (nor do I intend) to upgrade my Office 2003 for my XP notebook. Likewise, I would not recommend purchasing Outlook without a complementary Office edition. If you have a new PC with Vista, it's a good idea to use Office 2007 in whatever fashion is most economical for your needs. If you don't use Office, there are tons of great e-mail programs that are available at no charge and an Outlook stand-alone purchase makes little sense. I think Thunderbird/Firefox is a sound choice for the non-Office user.",0

"If you have a tablet like the Wacon Bamboo with a capture pen, the amazing speed and quality of the Corel Painter 2015 will make you swear you're working with paper and pencil.

They are there...everything you can imagine. This is simply the best version of Corel Painter.",0
"in broad terms, legal business Pro 2014, provides you with a framework and structure for you to hang your knowledge upon. I would not suggest that you rely upon this extensive library of contracts and forms if you have absolutely no knowledge of the law, or no experience with legal issues. That being said it is a first-class tool to use at state and federal level. The program itself is extraordinarily easy to install. The user agreement in the installation process is mildly amusing since it disavows any liability and
recommends that you should consult a lawyer, and the extent of any liability for the company that puts out the legal business Pro software is just for the cost of the program. That piece of mild amusement (at least for anyone who has done contract law at university level) aside, the program provides updates as you start and continues, if you register, to provide additional updates for two years after 31st of December 2014; one of the bonuses of registration is a 404 page contract law book.
  Once you start the program you have a whole list of resources including a library of legal books and even references to lawyers by category. When you start to create a document the program has a basic three-part interface: the first is create document. The second is read Nolo book from library. And the third is view checklist. A sizable amount of the forms that you can use are basically fill in the spaces type of documents, and for small businesses these will undoubtedly come in handy; about the only recommendation I would make is that wherever possible make sure that you have very good records, since (for example) a request for a bounced check to be honored, could quickly get to a small claims issue, and how something as simple as that is handled varies from state to state. The second reference to the library is probably going to be good for research for contracts, and finding cases with precedents where certain clauses are deemed enforceable, and certain closely worded ones are deemed not enforceable can usually be found in either case law or precedent books. In the more basic sense, the checklist in legal business Pro can help you through some easy things to sort out, as well as some moderately complex things to sort out. As good as this set of forms, contracts, and other references are in the legal realm, the biggest issue you will face, in my opinion, is the decision concerning when your own ability to handle issues is stretched to its limits, and it's time to call a lawyer. Still, it may be a big learning experience if you draft up a contract, whether agreement, lease, business related contract, and take it to a lawyer and see how far off the mark you might be. If you are halfway decent at researching you might actually find that you can draw up a contract that actually stands up to the test, and legal business Pro 2014 is definitely the set of tools to get you at least part of the way there.",0
"I love Ksperskys antivirus program. I have consistently used it since 2010. I have also tried other products such as McAfee and Norton and Titanium but none of them compares to Kaspersky as far as cpu usage, real time protection and updates. 2012 edition continues in the same edition with a more updated virus library.",0
"I am a PaintShop fan, for many years now. My needs are basic photo editing - cropping, lighting adjustments, redeye removal, and some added features such as borders and special effects. One of the things that Corel does so well is that it keeps these functions and their use about the same from version to version, so there is no steep learning curve when upgrading to a new release. This is a tried-and-true, reliable photo editing tool at a very good price. Not much more to ask for.",0

"The Office 2004 Student and Teacher Edition suite that I just received forms the final link in a chain from MacWrite and MultiPlan on a Macintosh 128k to Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks on a 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo iMac, and it has amazing similarity when installed in Panther (the OS I needed it to work with) to Office 2001 for Mac Academic version that I have on the same computer in Mac OS 9. After years of having to use iWork just to get an Office suite with a decent spreadsheet that didn't have the obfuscating UI of Office 2008's Excel, I jumped at the chance to get Office 2004 and while I only got one key, I can say on the intended machine it makes me want to use X in a way I never had the desire to do before, namely because the Lion and later native Office 2008 screwed up Excel's UI so badly.

To go from Excel 2004 to Excel 2008 is much more than just the lack of Visual Basic for Applications. It has to do with the UI of it, and whoever on the Excel 2008 design team thought that the Excel 2001 UI was outdated really does deserve to be fired.

As good as Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac is, I'm not into paying the same price for Office minus an email program, and while I may use Lion and later to write reviews, I do just as much general computing (mostly excluding the Internet) on the Mac OS 9 and now Panther extension paradigm.

I love Office 2004, now I see why everyone gave it such glowing reviews during the Tiger and Leopard phases of the Intel Mac era, because Office 2008 shot the wad on Excel.

Too bad I'll still be doing computing in 9 until I upgrade my CPU and memory on the Panther computer.",0

"There is no way that I could give the iLife suite anything but 5 stars.  I switched to the mac 1.5 years ago and have been intensely using iLife '08 for the entire time.  The suite of programs is just incredible.  I would probably pay upwards of $600 for the suite of programs, and it costs only [...].  Crazy.

The following review covers the new features added in iLife '09 that weren't in iLife '08.  There are a lot of new features, and I'll update my review after I spend time with each one.

iPhoto '09
FACE RECOGNITION: My iPhoto library is relatively small at 14,000 photos, most of which feature friends and family.  Because I'm a bit OCD, with iPhoto '08, I took the time to label all the photos with the names of the people contained in each picture.  I did this by writing the person's name in the ""Key Words"" field of each photo.  For a variety of reasons, my iPhoto library is much more valuable and useful to me when they are properly labeled with people's names.  As such, I was intrigued by the face recognition feature of iPhoto '09.  After allowing iPhoto '09 to scan my library of photos for faces (which took about 3 hours), I spent a handful of hours training iPhoto to know what everyone's faces look like.  This process (if you know how to do it) is indeed easier than the old way (of me typing in people's names in the ""key words"" field under each photo).  The facial recognition is pretty good, or maybe very good.  The problem I've discovered is that facial recognition is never going to be perfect.  Indeed some of the best photos have friends or family with their backs turned to the camera, or whatever, so facial recognition doesn't notice them.  If I were to rely solely on the facial recognition in iPhoto '09, I would fail to properly label all my pictures ... I'd miss some really really good pictures.  Then, months later, when I'm looking for a photo with my friend Sam, I won't be able to find certain photos, because it was never properly labeled with his name.  Long story short, I won't be using the facial recognition feature.  Instead, I'm going to continue to mark all my photos with names in the ""key words"" field of each photo.  Note also, the facial recognition feature cannot find the face of my parents' Dalmatian dog.

PRINTED BOOKS (MAPS FEATURE): the printed books that I've created with iPhoto '08 are amazing.  I've had several people say, ""I've gotta get a mac"" when they see the books I've made.  And, a few months ago, Apple announced that the pictures in the printed books are going to be even higher-res (haven't had a chance to print a book since the announcement), so the books should look even better now. A new feature in iPhoto '09 is the ability to add custom maps to your books.  For instance, I created a book with a map showing a travel line from NYC-Helsinki-Warsaw-Cracow-Budapest-Vienna-Prague.  The map looks awesome (see photo uploaded to amazon).  Printed books make the perfect gift or coffee table book.  (TIP: after you create the map, right-click on the map for additional advanced options (e.g., changing the connecting lines from _curved_ lines to _straight_ lines).  Criticism: while the large-scale maps (i.e., big city to big city to big city) look great, zoomed-in maps (i.e., of an individual city or town) have no detail.  (See the photo uploaded to amazon of my map of Warsaw, Poland).  Hopefully they'll fix this.

GEOTAGGING: this feature is so cool and totally belongs within iPhoto.  Years from now, when all the cameras have GPS built inside, it is going to be so convenient to have this metadata attached to photos.  That being said, I cannot imaging spending the time to label my 14,000 photos that don't currently have that data.  I did buy the ""Amod AGL3080 GPS Data Logger,"" to carry with me on trips so that I can add GPS data to new pictures I take.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  Update: I've had a chance to manually geotag some pictures (e.g., this batch of photos is ""Warsaw, Poland"").  It's pretty easy to tag photos.  That being said, there's really nothing amazing about having geotagged photos.  Hopefully future iterations of iLife will make use of having geotagged photos and movies (e.g., smart slide shows or movies that automatically include maps that zoom into pictures, or something).

GarageBand '09
MUSIC LESSONS: this is the most exciting part of iLife '09 for me.  These lessons look _better than real lessons_.  Seriously, better than live lessons with a real human.  I started the guitar lessons a week ago, and I just love them.  I can do the lesson over and over, at my own pace.  Apple really slammed this one out of the park.  I can't wait until I get good enough to use one of the $5 artist lessons.  Note: there are 9 free introductory piano lessons, and 9 free introductory guitar lessons (the lessons feature an acoustic guitar, but they appear to be useful for learning both acoustic and electric guitar ... same principles).  Note: Garageband includes a tuner, so that you can tune your guitar via your mac's microphone.  Well, it sucks and is nearly useless. (I'm using my iMac's built-in microphone).  I'm glad I bought this tuner: Korg GA-30 Ultra Compact Guitar and Bass Tuner (it works for both my electric and acoustic guitar).

I'll update the review when I've had a chance to use the 1-2 dozen new features that are important to me.",0
This is a wonderful group of software with easy to use features for people who do not have time to go through manuals or extensive classes. iPhoto is why I bought this software.,0
"I bought two copies of the Win8 Pro upgrade, one for myself and one for my elderly mother.  In my case, the upgrade program found one incompatible application on my Windows 7 computer; once that's removed (the upgrade program does it for you when you tell it to go ahead and remove the application), everything went smoothly and it took less than 20 minutes to upgrade.  Then my mother upgraded her Win7 machine, too, and reported no problems.  Microsoft really did an excellent job this time with the upgrade path.",0
"My 10 year old girl and 13 year old boy had to be pulled off the computer after playing this for 5 hours straight (yeh, I know that is too long but I was working and getting so much done!).  They did not fight the entire time they played the game.  I could hear them laughing and encouraging each other to build higher (only one can play at at time).
They told me it reminded them of a combination of Zoombinis and Crazy Action Contraptions but was more fun.

Highly recommend if you need a little time to yourself without too much guilt.",0
very good,0
"I purchased this for my daughter to use at college and it has all of the essentials you used through high school.  There are some cheaper and free alternatives, but this is the real deal and what she wanted for school.",0
"One might feel pity for the creators and marketers of programs like Poser 9. They invest their all into a fine application - which this is - but the market is inherently limited to those who want to produce 3D renderings. There are many people who would love to do that, but it is a difficult undertaking.

 So the marketers claim it is an easy thing to do, that learning how to do it is simple. They laughed when I sat down to create a 3D rendering of a woodland nymph . . . and they were right.

 Creating 3D renderings isn't simple, though the folks who publish Poser try to make it easier with each new version. I own several of the earlier versions and, speaking generally, would give up in minutes.

 Poser 9 is an excellent product, but it has a fairly steep learning curve and possessing artistic talent is not optional, it is a requirement. They include a ton of content and the interface is usable. There are a couple of books about using Poser and picking up a used copy of one for an earlier version is a good investment.

 If you have the time, though, and the discipline to work through each step, you can master Poser 9.

 Personally, considering the low level of my skills, I prefer Reallusion iClone and Daz Studio: they're not necessarily as capable as Poser 9, but they are somewhat easier for novices to approach.

 But, as I said, if you can devote the time and energy to learning Poser 9 and practice, practice, practice, you can turn out truly exquisite work with this application. I just wish I could.

"Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great.

Loaded quickly and easily, and worked!

What else could you ask for?",0
"Need to network computers on different floors?  This product can be used as a bridge or as an interface for an individual machine.  All I had to do was take the units out of the box, plug them in to the power line and the Ethernet switch (using the supplied patch cable), and it all worked right away.  Just a word of warning, though;  you can't plug these into a surge protector (including any surge protector inside a power strip.)",0
"NIS is the best overall product.  I've tried other stuff, especially when Norton got to bloated a couple years back.  But now they do pretty well.

Norton: according to unbiased tests, you need to respond to zero day  threats faster.  A few of your competitors do a better job than you, and there is no excuse for that given your wide customer base.

I don't like the goofy white background menus.  The previous black and gold was much better looking.

The only minor problem I have with the program is that I have my firewall set for private network, however, when the system boots up I get to messages.  It states private network, but then a new pop-up says unconnected to a public network.  However upon checking settings, they verify that I am in fact connected to a private network, which is correct.  So there's an extra pop-up with erroneous data.",0
"The pre-made contracts and forms are a blessing in disguise.  They are certainly very useful to get you going and give you an idea of what you may need to have in an agreement on many issues, however, if it's something really serious I wouldn't blindly use the forms here but edit them very carefully or have a lawyer look at them for you.

One really good feature of this product are the fully sercheable books which is really nice to keyword something in and find as much information as you can.  You can google it too, however, you have to sort out a lot of useless information on Google, here, it's all organized and professional!

Also:  buying this instead of the books individually certainly saves you a bundle, so might as well get them like this, sercheable, than in print.",1
"I will tell you right now what makes this piece of software one of a kind.

Most (other) language learning software is based on templates. They have a single template for your learning needs and they just fill the blanks for each different language. That's just like having a single universal template on how to ""drive"" and then hoping to fill the blanks for a car, a bike, a truck and a tank, no matter how different they actually are.

Fluenz is different. Even though they probably follow similar scenarios for the different languages, it's downright obvious that each lesson was created from scratch according to the language's specific traits and difficulties.

All the explanations you'll find in Fluenz French are there for a reason, and that reason belongs to the specific language you are learning. What may need 10 minutes of explanation in one language, may take no time in another.

Something else Fluenz gets right is that they teach you how to say ideas in the new language, not only words and grammar, but whole ideas. That's what you need for fluency. I've been learning languages for quite a while, English is not even my native language, and you can trust me when I tell you that having to construct phrases in your head putting grammar rules and words together every time you speak will take you nowhere.

Finally, perhaps irrelevant at first sight but unmistakably important a few hours later: it has the right ambiance. It has nice background music, i.e. it doesn't feel mechanic or boring.

I'm not an easy guy to please with this kind of software but so far I've done about one third of the program and I'm extremely happy with it.",0
"For many basic forms, this is a good tool.  It tells you state by state what formality is required in executing a will, a financial power of attorney, a healthcare power of attorney, etc., so it is not too generic.  If you need something complicated in a will, such as a trust for a child, you probably want to employ an attorney, but the WillMaker Plus is good for basic documents with an easy, answer-the-questions approach.",0
"I originally used WordPerfect and migrated to MS Office due to my work environment so it's been more than a decade since I last tried Corel's alternative office suite. Amazingly, as Office has become more convoluted since the 2010 version with useless task ribbons and endless security options, WordPerfect has stepped in to fill the void where you can find many lost MS users.

WordPerfect is practically 100% compatible in file formats, has some great PDF tools and a massive library of extra software and content. Many of the features that used to be simple in Office are well implemented here - columns, tables, footers, headers and all the features you would use frequently are very obvious. A few of options are different to Office but are easy to find and understand and overall this is simple version that's very fast and stable.

Comparing Corel and Microsoft in their latest office suites, my observation would be that WordPerfect has been developed with the user in mind (and many features have clearly been UI tested) where MS has approached the problem based around what they feel the user should like, given their predisposition to Windows 8 and touchscreen interfaces. Ultimately, it's a personal preference but if you've been frustrated with newer versions of Office, the WordPerfect suite might be a welcome upgrade.",0
"Apple has made a huge leap with this ""Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar"". The several components, (as well as the respective features contained in them), are well-integrated and stable. I am particularly thrilled by the ease with which its 'Rendezvous' linked my device to other devices, without requiring any sort of configuration. All other components work just as fine.
Like the big cat it was named after, this OS waxes strong. It is resilient too!",0
"Microsoft's 2009 Streets and Maps comes with a small GPS and all of the software guts needed to stay on track perfectly, so perfectly, in fact, that my daughter took it for herself and is using it in another city. ""Could you write a book report on it?"" I implored. Still waiting. But between her laptop and the MS 2009 package, she's never had a problem from state-to-state. That's a lot of driving, and sometimes into districts that defy maps. That's a short endorsement, but as a dad, I'm not worried about her getting lost... ever.",0
Did teh job.,0
"Easy to install, easy to use with decent parental controls, Trend Micro has outdid themselves again.  It works well on my netbook as well as one of my other systems and doesn't get in the way the way McAfee and other security suites do.  It's great because you don't have to buy extra copies as it allows you to install it on three different computers.  I highly recommend it.",0
"No doubt AVG's Internet Security Program is by far the best - exceeds Norton, far exceeds McAfee and the rest -  Amazon's 3 pack 2 - year edition price is the best value around!",0
"This version of McAfee offers a whole bundle of features, including some cool stuff that isn't on previous versions.  Installation is fast and easy, even though you have to remove your existing anti-virus software, and it doesn't cause application errors or slow down system performance.  The single CD in the package can provide protection for up to three computers for one year, after which you need to shell out for the annual fee at the going rate. Installation also offers the option of installing from the CD provided and then updating from the web after installation is completed or downloading the application from the web and then installing.

It has a simple, user friendly appearance and a choice of two interfaces -basic and advanced.  It should be noted that some of the options are only available to persons logged in as ""administrators"" and not to the other users on your computer with limited permissions.  If you're the only user you can consider yourself promoted to Administrative level.

""So what does it DO?"" enquiring minds want to know. Well, here goes.

1.  It provides a firewall as your computer's first line of defense against identity theft, viruses, spyware, spam, hackers and other bad things that go ""bump"" in cyberspace.  There's a ""lockdown"" feature that stops all internet access with one click.

2.  It makes web-surfing safer by rating your search results, as well as the sites you visit, using a color code.  Green = safe; Yellow = caution; Red = get the heck out of there NOW.  (Works with Google, Yahoo! And MSN searches.)

3.  Automatic updates and upgrades

4.  Stops viruses in their tracks, as well as worms, Trojans and other slimy things, and then automatically cleans or quarantines the little boogers.  The QuickScan feature patrols the vulnerable areas of your computer to check for threats.

5.  Offers you a ""stealth mode"" that blocks incoming network connections so you can lurk on the internet without being detected by hackers.

6.  Blocks spyware, adware, and other bad ""wares"" from stealing your log-ins and passwords, tracking your cookies, or filling your screen with pop-ups.

7.  Keeps your computer uncluttered with a QuickClean system that takes out the trash, such as temporary files, cached files, lost file fragments, deleted e-mail messages and other undesirable junk.

8.  It includes a ""Shredder"" for permanently deleting top secret documents such as love letters or romantic poems penned under the influence.  To make it even cooler, there are three different shredding levels.

9.  Automatically recognizes spam, phish and scams, fake virus messages and all that weird foreign language stuff, and stops it from filling your in-box

10.  Provides different levels of blocking depending on the age or maturity level of your child.  It has easy to understand settings like ""young child"", ""child"", ""younger teen"", ""older teen"" or ""adult"".  Age appropriate searching makes sure that the safety filters of some popular search engines are enabled. It uses keyword filtering and even blocks offensive images.

11.  Provides an automatic back-up feature which requires the installation of Microsoft.net Framework 1.1

12.  Tactfully defers certain updates and alerts while you're watching movies or playing games in full-screen mode to prevent interruptions.

Recommended for PCs and small networks, families with internet-savvy kids and people who like to go into sites marked with 3 X's.

"It starts by interview and then step by step instruction with help topics along the way. it has a calculator included and IRS forms of many kind more than what I needed. The state filing was also easy though E filing cost little extra with no clear advantage for Illinois as it is simple for me.
It doe import data from lost year and files in the stuff where it is needed even at the end where you use it as a pin to file the E File. E file for federal is free. It has even a gift card section where you can get part of it to spend a t best buy. You can spend it at Amazon.",0

"Corel VideoStudio is a great, affordable and user friendly software for editing videos. I'm not very tech savvy and usually find most  video editing programs too complicated and too cumbersome to use. I am amazed at how much you get with Corel for under $70!

The included instructions were also very helpful in getting started with the software, figuring out tips and tricks, etc.",0
"This program is still the best program on the market for amateurs and other levels of the everyday user and maybe even a few `pro-sumers' like me. If you're a parent and your goal is to just very simply create some nice looking home movies to burn on DVD and distribute to other family members or even upload directly to Youtube (which is a very nice feature), then Ulead Video Studio is looking like the best program out there for doing so. It's also, by far, the easiest to use and understand while not forfeiting presentation quality and features doing so. The learning curve on this is very fast and dedicating a mere ten minutes to the manual will yield pretty impressive results.

Some folks might think that you'll have to invest thousands of dollars on a new Mac so you can have a new version of iLife and do all this without having an intimate knowledge of video editing or processing, but this really is a much better and a much cheaper alternative. While buying a Mac is always a cool prospect, you may not have to do that just yet.

The only drawback I could find was in using the built-in `Movie Wizard' which is a bit restrictive, even though it's `drag and drop'. Creating movies this way, renders your footage faster and gives you a much grainer, or lower resolution end result. If you can avoid using this feature, I would, as having the ability to fully control the output settings is an absolute must.",0

The free version was easy to use and resulted in a higher return than I was expecting, so I was quite pleased with it. I was going to use the free version of TaxAct for comparison purposes, but was never able, not even after multiple tries, to successfully register with the TaxAct website, so I don't recommend that one,",1

I have owned this NAS for almost a year now and actually purchased a second one.  It works flawlessly and QNAP live tech support is superb. There is also a fairly comprehensive forum for users as well. I have slowly upgraded my capacities as newer larger capacity drives have come out on the market.  All have been recognized and the space expanded without a hitch. I highly recommend this product.,0
"The Family Tree Maker Mac 3 Deluxe genealogy software is simply awesome. After using this product over a period of time, I have grown to really love it. Although I am not a big fan of Ancestry.com I have been able to use this product with the website and it has been beneficial even though I have already traced many of my family lines. There have been some interesting snipits of information gathered from other sources and other people's lines.

I like the way pictures and information can be easily added and it is very easy to use. I have also backed up my family files and transfered them over to my Family Tree Maker program for my PC computer with absolutely no problems. I wish that the pictures I added for the family tree would autocrop themselves so that they filled in the picture square perfectly. As it is the picture doesn't always fill the square and leaves blank sides for rectangle pictures.",0

The tech I use told me that I had to two choices: reinstall Windows 8.1 or buy Windows 7, which he recommended as being better than Windows 8.

"I bought it two month ago, my modem and router are like 50 yards away from my bedroom, I was trying to get some internet access while I was watching tv or looking over my child, it was impossible not only for the distance, it was also for the material of the walls of the house, it is some kind of hard concrete that blocks away any type of signals, even 900 mhz frecuency from my wireless phones. I tried getting out the wireless router and aim it to the room, it did not work. I tried buying a wireless signal extender, did not work eather, I tried buying an extra large antenna that comes with a long cable, I hooked it to my router and put it rigth in the hallway aiming directly to my bedroom, it showed some signal but poorly enough to not be accesible. I was comited to find the solution and while I was searching around the internet I found this product. dessperate as I was I decided to try it even if I did not have any prior reference of it. I came home, hooked it and it has not stopped working since. I recomended it widely, easy to set up and noiseless.
Wonderful product, congrats.

"While I've used Adobe Premier, Adobe Premier Element and also iMovie in the past, I've largely relied on the simple and basic Windows Movie Maker for my home video editing needs. (I put together a lot of home movies showcasing my kids doing silly things all kids do.)

Corel's Video Studio Pro X6 really surprised me. First of all, it's really easy to get started. I had been expecting something complicated, having used Corel's other creative products before. The editor screen here makes it easy to know where the tools are and how to apply the tools, unlike some other home video software. What I really like is the large number of video input formats it supports, since I use a large variety of digital cameras and camcorders.  What I love is it supports the AVHCD format (versions 1.0 and 2.0), used by all the Japanese camcorders.  I run this on a Toshiba i7 laptop with Win7, and importing the highest-quality AVHCD files is a breeze. I have only used this for a little over a week, but so far it's been a solid piece of software.

One feature I think I'll take advantage of is the subtitle editor. Members of my family are hearing-challenged, so I think this will be a pleasant change for them, for me to add subtitles to the videos I force them to watch. :)

The packaging claims this program also supports the new 4k Ultra HDTV format. I don't have the resources to test this claim, but if it's true, that's nice, even though I'll probably never get to use it with this version.

I'm really have a good time with this program. Finally I can say good-bye to the trusty but too basic Windows Movie Maker.",0

"I have long been a fan of McAfee.  Occasionally, I would stray and try another product, but I always come back.  My last subscription was for McAfee Total Protection.  Aside from the interface, I can't really tell the difference.  They both protect unlimited devices.  They both track / remote lock / wipe my phones.  Neither of them make my system sluggish.  Total Protection doesn't backup to the cloud, but I don't use that.

The box came with a code printed on a card and instructions for downloading the product.  That's it.  McAfee has done a good job of streamlining the process.  Used to be a big pain to download a new edition of their software.  This time, McAfee detected that I had Live Safe two years ago, so it extended that subscription to expire next year.  I downloaded it with Total Protection still running on my computer.  I didn't have to uninstall anything.  McAfee automatically took care of it for me.

Right now, I have Live Safe on my phone and PC and I will spend the day installing it on everything else.  We have three PCs, four laptops, four cell phones, and some tablets.  Unlimited devices, yeah!

P.S.  I recommend what others have done: Buy last year's model.  You still get the latest virus protection for less.",0
Arrived as described.  I was pleased with purchase,0
"Having worked with Windows 8.1 for a while now, and having also worked with various other devices/operating systems, here are my opinions:

Windows 8.1 vs Windows 8.0: Why compare?  The upgrade is free and there is nothing but upside.

Windows 8.1 vs Windows 7: In my opinion, Windows 8.1 has all the functionality of Windows 7, and then some.  Some folks really seem upset at how the start menu was changed, but it took me about a day to adjust to that.  You can still find all of your apps using the same keystrokes (or mouse clicks) that you already used.  The ""look"" of the tiles popping up rather than a long list of apps has changed, but that's really it.  My advice - if you're already on Windows XP or later, ignore the naysayers and make the upgrade (assuming your PC is compatible).  Then give yourself a week of using it steadily before you pass judgment.

Windows 8.1 vs Mac OS: In my opinion, Windows 7 pretty much gave me all the benefits of the Mac OS (I know I'll get some negative comments for that, but I truly did use both and came back to Windows when they came out with Win 7).  So, based on my previous paragraph, I think Windows 8.1 compares well to the Mac OS.  Unless you're using Windows 8.1 in tablet mode, I don't think I'd go so far as to say it is vastly superior to Mac - only comparable.

Windows 8.1 vs iPad: This assumes you're using a tablet with Win 8.1 (I'm using a Surface Pro).  I tried using an iPad for a few years and other than playing games, surfing the web and checking email, it never seemed to be a great device for me.  I wanted something I could type notes into and even work on documents.  I tried adding a keyboard and apps that worked with Microsoft Office.  But just never seemed to quite work for me.  Essentially, I only did the kinds of things with my iPad that I would do with a phone.  With Windows 8.1 on a tablet device, I get nearly all the benefits of an iPad (though iPads do still have some advantages in tablet mode, such as form factor, weight and battery life - but none of those matter much if I can't be productive) AND I get all the advantages of a laptop PC.  And without lugging two devices all over the place.

Using Win 8.1, I dock my Surface Pro at the office and it is a full powered desktop computer with fullsize keyboard, mouse and monitor.  When working with clients, I have a small keyboard, or I have a stylus that allows me to take handwritten notes and draw pictures (this can be a big deal when you're consulting - a keyboard puts a ""wall"" between you and a client, and trying to use a stylus with an iPad to take notes was a non-starter for me).",0
"I've been teaching media at the college level for 15 years and I find these Core Training disks a great too for introducing complex software suits from Adobe. The interface is easy to navigate and the information is appropriate for the level the set is targeting. The videos are well produced and show the functions in a way that is easily transferable to actual real-world tasks.

Setup couldn't be eaiser, just pop the DVD into your computer's drive, then peel the book off the back of the package and you're ready to go. The book and DVD compliment each very well, but you can use either separately without loosing a thing.

The package covers all the basics and a few things a bit more advanced. I highly reccomend this series as a thorough introduction to this software.",0
Thanks,0
"This is a simple, step by step program that allows to build a basic last will and testament.  When I mean basic, it allows to cover the steps that you need to think through, in GENERAL, with regard to basic statements, basic building steps, correct wording and bequests.  And for most people, this is sufficient.  The interface is super easy to navigate, and it produces a clean basic will.  The advance directives, power of attorney documents are also easy to navigate, complete and print.

What this doesn't have (that I could find) was a way to recognize living members of your immediate family - to stave off court challenges from relatives that felt that they had been slighted; because that kind of thing can and does happen.

I also liked that there is also a proviso for your electronic accounts and files.  Most people think of ""things"" or ""money amounts"" when it comes to bequests, but seldom do we think of who gets our electronic files, digital pictures and the like.  This also includes a schedule of electronic subscriptions, apps, emails, credit accounts, online banking, etc. and so on.

However, this program is NOT an easy bypass for wills that are overtly complicated and involve legal maneuvering outside of basic bequests.  So if your estate planning does involve advance tax planning for heirs, etc. you will need to work with a licensed, qualified probate attorney.",0
Great deal for three computers. Only one year but the ones I needed to license were older and may not even be needed after a year. I have always used Norton products with hardly any problems or conflicts.

"Years ago I used to boycott Norton Antivirus because it was slow and bloated.  However, about five or six years ago, Norton re-wrote their product from the ground up, and ever since then I have been a big fan.  Norton Antivirus 2014 offers fantastic protection for relatively little money, considering this contains three licenses, for use on three different PCs.  Not only is Norton usually rated either the best or the second best by various PC magazines (including Maximum PC), it does not bog down the PC.  It's hardly noticeable and has pretty much zero impact after installation.  It keeps itself up-to-date, and only notifies you when a problem occurs.  I find that Antivirus has everything I need:  protection from all kinds of malware and adware.  I like it better than Norton Internet Security or 360 because those products provide extra things I don't need, like parental guidance, etc.  Anti-virus has everything you need to keep you safe.",0
"Great price. Others can be had for free, but you sometimes get what you pay for.",0
"WinZip 18 is the latest version of the popular zip and compression software from Corel. While there are many free and shareware options available, they aren't always compatible with many systems. 7-Zip, a popular option was used by my company. I had to stop using it because everyone I sent zip files to could not open or read anything compressed with 7-Zip even though many had the program installed on their computers. We never had this problem using WinZip. It is a standard that does work well with virtually any program. I didn't see a large amount of difference between version 17 as opposed to version 18. It is still fast and efficient. I do love the integration with the cloud services. WinZip will zip to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive (formerly Skydrive from Microsoft), Box, SugarSync and CloudMe. It will also zip to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It also will encrypt your files for protection. The Cloud navigation has been improved, though it was always easy for me to access my Cloud zips before. You can also send links to you zip files in the Cloud if you need to share them. I also love the fact that you can create PDF files from WinZip and add watermarks. That is a great option if you don't have a PDF creator available. You can also create self-extracting zip files for those who don't have a zip program. It handles the usual RAR, 7-Zip, BZ2 and many others. When extracting encrypted files WinZip does auto wipe the temporary files for protection One new feature are the WinZip Express Add-Ons. The new Add-Ons are available for Windows Explorer (in Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows 8 has replaced Explorer with OneDrive), photos, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint (Enterprise option for work) and photos. As is normal for Corel, only the Add-On for Explorer is free to registered users of WinZip 18. The other options are $12.95 with a discount for registered users of $9.95 at the time of this writing. Although I find WinZip to be the best service for zipping, compressing and encrypting files that I have used, Corel charges for everything now, upgrades to Pro, extra charges for the Add-Ons. I am certain these were separated because inclusion would have made the program more costly and everyone does not need as many features. WinZip has also ballooned to include a wide variety of services besides the base product and you will hear about those after you register your email address (required). It is still the best overall for regular consumers and the easiest to use that works with nearly everything. I still highly recommend it since I have tried several other compressions that are too complicated to use and/or others were not able to read the compressed files. Zipping, compressing and encryption do word much faster and easier with WinZip.",0
Its Windows 10. It works well,0
Great program! Works flawlessly in the background after setup. Easy to use and very flexible  . I rely on this for all my backup needs. I have used this and Disk Director for many years. It just keeps getting better with each new release. It has saved me on more than one occasion.,0
"Installing and running McAfee on a Windows 7 laptop was easy and non-intrusive. It asked me to set up an ID so I could download and use it on 3 different systems, I did that for ease. It did ask for auto renewal that I declined and then it started installing. I had to uninstall a previous virus protection software that had expired before installing McAfee. It was not intrusive like setting up Norton on my other laptop.

McAfee takes care of virus protection and online security, it does make some sites load slower. Other than that it does not interfere with the workings and does not slow down the system. It also updated definitions in the background and did not make it a fussy process like Norton which kept saying ""Your system is unprotected"" and made me do several tasks manually before it was up and running.

The only negative criticism I have is that it deleted all my cookies without asking and also all my passwords that were stored in Chrome. That made life difficult, if I had known it would do that I would have first changed those passwords.",0
"I have been running 2013 Plus for almost a year on 2 Windows 8 Pro 64bit computers. It has worked flawlessly. With several scheduled backups on each at different times and backup locations.
 I recieved an offer directly from Acronis to upgrade to 2014. I emailed them as to what improvments were made and they said Interface and cloud/Network backup. I thought I would give it a try.
 Glad I did. It is much faster than 2013. The GUI is a little cleaner.
 I have now got 3 Win 8 computers running Acronis Premium. 2014. They all have multiple backups to different locations. No problems at all.
 I recommend intergrating Acronis into the Windows boot. It gives an ""F11"" Boot option at bootup, so you can go into Acronis instead of booting. Restores and backups both work from a ""Linux"" enviroment. It works great. You can also make bootable media from Acronis to do the same thing on DVD or CD.
 Warning....This is a powerful product. Please read the Manual.
 The ""Clone feature"" is in my opinion, the best on the market. I have done several and they worked everytime.
 Also recommended is to set frequent ""Validation"" of all backups. Just  to make sure they will work.
 If you need a powerful Clone/Backup program this is a Highly recommended buy.",0

"Shifted over to Turbotax Deluxe last year (2013)just to get a product made by the same company as Quicken Mac.  Prior to that I had been using TaxCut (HR Block) for 10+ years.  I found the products to be similar and both gave the same result and refund.  Now getting ready to buy for 2014 taxes and find by the many reviews that Turbotax Deluxe does not cover filing of Schedule D (efile) and as a result I must buy Turbotax Premier which is $40 more than HR Block.  I am one of those that is shifting back to HR Block Deluxe.

Intuit let me know when you plan to revise Turbotax Deluxe to support Schedule D filing.  Your greediness lost another customer

Update after using HRBlock 2014. Very happy I shifted over to HRBlock from Turbotax.
Bought HRBlock Deluxe for 2014 after using Turbotax for several years and Taxcut before that. I shifted over to HRBlock (used to be Taxcut) after reading many Turbtax reviews that you can no longer use TT Deluxe for Sched D efiling for the 2014 version. TT requires you to buy TT Premier at a cost that is 2x that of HRBlock Deluxe. I found HRBlock excellent. It imported last year Turbotax files as well as Quicken for Mac 2015 files without error. I found HR Block easier to use and the import was more complete than Turbtax (TT) deluxe. I am very happy with the shift to HRBlock. All of my fears of shifting tax software were unfounded. TT has gotten greedy and others should consider letting the market send a loud no buy message to Intuit (TT parent).",0
"Up until this year I've never used tax software, and rarely had to do my own taxes at any point in my life (once or twice with a 1040 EZ as I remember was about it.)  This year my husband reluctantly agreed to let me give it whirl after he missed a few things on our return last year, and we ended up having to pay more taxes and complete an amended return.

When I went looking at the various tax software programs and read the reviews, I decided H&R was the one for me. Married, filing jointly with some self-employment and retirement income and filing for only one state residency, ""Premium"" was what we needed to get things done.

-------------------------------

The interview questions help you through most of it, but I did get stumped a few times. Reading the help section got me through, however I did find I needed to re-do at least half a dozen things before all was said and done. This could have just been my inexperience with the whole process or not accurately interpreting the 'help' info provided.

Having everything in front of me and entering data as I went along was easy. Once the federal return is complete, the State return kind of does itself. I got a little nervous a few times thinking I'd sent in my return, but thankfully there are several checks and balances in place that won't allow that to happen.

While this wasn't what I'd call 'simple', it was easier than sitting down with sheets of paper and a booklet, trying to make sense of it all. Calculations are automatically done for you, and deductions are maximized. Questions are generally very clear and explanations as to the nuances of what things are 'covered' are concise and in layman's terms.

This software definitely helped me to maximize our deductions, and gain insight into what I can do this year to help us for next years taxes. It made seeing the bigger picture easier than it had been in the past for my husband too.

-----------------------------

The best thing about this software is the quantity and quality of information I received from doing our taxes this way. It made me think about next year, and relieved that it's likely to be a much easier process with this e-file done and in the system.

I liked that H&R's software provided us with glitch-free filing. A print and mail-in option was available (a way to save the twenty bucks on your state filing with a longer wait for a refund) , but since I heard that both my federal and state returns were accepted within 1 hour of submitting them via e-file, the twenty bucks spent on the state return was well worth it for both a quick refund and peace of mind.

I will definitely use this software next year, and recommend it to others.

-----------------------------------

UPDATE 4/8/15:

Received confirmation of acceptance of both State and Federal returns within 5 hours of filing them. Federal tax payment was taken out of my account within 8 hours of that confirmation, and we received a deposit of our refund from the State within 7 days.

I feel like this was a much more comprehensive way to to our taxes than the old paper version, and I'm relieved that next year we'll be all set to do it again using H&R!",0

"Norton Internet Security is the ONLY anti-virus software I trust for my PCs. Sure, it costs a bit more than most of those other competitors, but my peace-of-mind is worth it! New features include ""Safe Web"" which checks each website for validity and security; ""Identity Safe"" which can manage your passwords; and a Symantec website you can use to check the validity of a suspect URL. It even gives you a map of your home network. Many more features are included.  I highly recommend!!",0

So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings.  I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky.

Well two years later I have not looked back.  I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out.  They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc.  After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle.

"It has been said that the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is caused from a perceived disconnection from the Divine--either within oneself or in the universe at large.

We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.

Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.

In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.

Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:

*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video

*More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""

*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh

*Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors

*""Light Stone"" energy translator

*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences

*Original Soul Flight music CD

*Companion Guide and User's Manual

The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.

The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

"I'm still working through the basics. So far, this is an awesome package. Chinese is tough because of the strange alphabet and the language is totally different from English. Even though I have a busy schedule, I'm still able to learn Chinese bit by bit in the time that I do have. This is an expensive package, but worth it. It's nice to be able to go at your own pace. I would not call myself intellectual, but Rosetta Stone makes learning languages a fun hobby.

Included in this package are:
* printed manuals (very nice - a lot of software packages neglect these)
* software CDs for all 3 levels
* audio companion CDs for all 3 levels
* USB headphone and microphone set

The software allows you to focus on the aspects of the language you want to learn first and provides you a total immersion environment. Rather than dull repetition, the software guides you through the learning process with related graphics so you see & hear the words at the same time.

Even with all the goodies, the work isn't done for you, as with anything if you want to learn it, you do have to put some effort into it.",0
"Corel Painter X3 is the most powerful paint program Corel makes and it functions a lot like Photoshop. That's a good thing. It means not having to relearn many of the tools. The floating palettes, menus and interface should be immediately intuitive to anyone who has used an Adobe product. Buttons and key functionality are even located in the same place on the screen and much of the terminology is the same. As a web professional, I use Photoshop every day and I know a lot of people who use Photoshop exclusively to paint with as well. It is one of the major tools for professional digital artists and game developers, so why would you consider Painter over Photoshop?

Whereas Photoshop has evolved into an all-purpose tool for digital artists, photographers, graphic designers, and web developers, Painter is a more specialized tool aimed at serious digital painters who want to paint. The brush options are extensive and bewildering, designed to feel the way natural brushes and media feel. For example, you can control the wetness, viscosity and evaporation rate of certain brushes and inks and paints. Experimenting with traditional media in real life would cost you quite a bit of money. To get the most of out the product, you'll need a Wacom tablet. Using just the mouse, it is unable to detect pressure and brush orientation.

The 943-page manual is available as a PDF from Corel's website. Corel also maintains an extensive YouTube channel for tutorials and showcases as well as on its own site. Corel offers a fully-functional time-limited demo for you to try out to see if it's right for you. If you don't need all the featuresor are just starting out, you can go with one of the earlier versions of Painter at a considerable savings.",0

"To my surprise, I have discovered that WordPerfect is NOT dead!  It can only get better from that antiquated software of the early 90s, and Microsoft blew them away.  But, I guess there is reincarnation!

I like the program, and what I like is that one can open this to be strictly WordPerfect style OR, get this...you can have it open this in a Microsoft Word mode.  Excellent option!  And when I become more acquainted, I may choose the WordPerfect mode.

But I can't help but think that these software programs should create simple, easier to use, usable programs.  The average user will never get to some sections.  And why would we need the  And you need to purchase the impressive Corel Visual Intelligence, which is mainly geared for businesses.

The WordPerfect Lighting for creating notes seems redundant to a Word doc, and I see this program as unnecessary, not extremely beneficial.  For a busy Word professional, I'm quite sure it can be helpful, or if you have nothing better to do, go for it.

There are many neat features in WordPerfect, so many that one needs to experiment with and compare to Microsoft Word.  Excel too, has some great benefits and features that you have not seen in Word, and with time, you will learn them.

If you want to incorporate your email setup to the WordPerfect email, you have that option.

You can learn a lot from this WordPerfect program, unfortunately, the average user doesn't have a whole lot of time for learning more software, new software, or complicated software.  But all in all, this is NICE !!.....Rizzo",0

I really like this software.  It's very easy to use and very fast.  I recognize the need for keeping your hard drive clean for more efficient use and in the past have used several producst to do this.  WinCleaner allows me to do all that with just one product.  After you install it you can configure it to do what you want it to do.  From that point forward you just have to remember to click one button to run the software.  Works beautifully and keeps my 4 year hard drive running smoothly.,0
"I make videos for my business.  I promote my products on YouTube and my website, and have used the previous version of this program for over a year now.  I LOVE it--it is so easy and has built-in models so even the most novice person can make a video.

I know that I will NEVER use all of the available technology in this program.  It's totally over my head.  I could study the books and online tutorials (they are awesome, btw), but I really don't have the time.

For my use--promoting product--you can input a bunch of photos and decide how long each photo is displayed, and cue up music to work with your selections.  There are subtitles and introductory/exit screens that you can personalize with ease.  You can change music midstream, and link multiple video clips together (along with the photos).  You can speed up the video clips or slow them down, depending on what you're highlighting.

I must say, I wish I had time and use for learning all of the ins-and-outs of this program, because it's really amazing.  I can't wait for grandkids--we will be  making lots of family videos then :)",0

"TTax2013 is solid and fast as were the prior tax-year versions.  Thankfully you can usually pick it up at a discounted price ($50 -vs- $60) at Amazon earlier than from other sellers (Intuit is usually the LAST one to offer a price-break),  I have only bought TTax on CD over the years (not digital download) so that I have the disc just in case I might need to re-install at some future (like IF the TaxMan were to come a'knockin', God forbid).  Point being I can't comment on the Download approach.
My only gripe with Intuit (not this package, per se) is the $40 gouge price for an additional State.  At thathigh price, it's got to be a super-high margin item for Intuit's bottom line.

Off-topic slightly, I *do* wish that Intuit would:
 - Make TTax available for Linux operating systems  (likely won't happen though, given that TTax & Quicken both rely on Microsoft Windows' .Net framework;
 - Make a TurboTax- style program for preparing and filing Federal Estate, Gift, and Trust returns.  (Maybe they will. should considering the aging Baby Boomer demographics).",0

"I have also taken a local community college on-line course on DreamWeaver CS5 training. This video in comparison is quite a bit better in terms of the rich contents and course layout. The video has 17 sections covering the key elements of CS5 which allow the user to learn how to create a local web site from scratch and uploading it to the server. Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.

There are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.

All in all, this is a great product for the price.",0
"PC Mag [...] had rated this very highly which is how I learned of it.  The full article is available at [...].  It is a very good, inexpensive, dependable backup software application.  It has good flexibility and is user friendly (for a backup program).  It allows you to back up an entire hard drive or just selected folders and files.  You can do full or incremental backups and you can schedule them or initiate them manually.  I have mine scheduled for a full backup once a week and a daily incremental backup, all to a removable USB hard drive.  You can tell it to break the back up into 2 GByte slices so you can keep the backup hard drive nicely decluttered by running Windows defrag program from time to time.  We have a Windows XP operating system and it works very well with that.  The program also allows you to create a disaster recovery CD and a corresponding disaster recovery backup on a hard drive.  You can set levels for compression and encryption and set password protection or not.  The more the compression and encryption, the longer the backup takes but the smaller and more secure it is (the default values are fine for me).  You can also adjust the intensity of the backup effort so it will run more slowly in the background so it won't interfere with you while you are using the computer or more quickly if you schedule the backups to be done at night (as I do).  The manufacturer was very responsive when I had some initial questions about it.  Unlike Norton Ghost, which we also have, it will not communicate on-line when you tell it not to.

To add to my initial review one year later (January 2010): in a year of ownership I have greatly benefited by learning to depend on the program's termination features. You can have it just run the backup on schedule and stop, or after the backup you can also set it to automatically perform ""power"" functions. These include shutdown, log off, Standby, and Hibernate (assuming you have configured your computer for Hibernate). What this means is that my copy of this program at work starts a backup a little after my normal office hours and shuts the computer down afterwards. So I get an incremental backup of the day's complete work without spending productive office time doing it and save energy by turning it off, too. At home I have it tuck itself into Standby after our normal bed time. So we get full use of the computer all day, a backup of the day's activities afterwards, and don't let it run up our utility bill, either. And Standby turns off the USB backup drive as well to preserve its longevity.  On the other end of the spectrum you can set it to wake up your computer from Standby to run a backup before you need to use the computer.  The settings also show up in the Scheduled Tasks for Windows XP and Windows Vista (unlike any of the Ghost products). We now have four licensed copies of Genie. It is easily a better backup tool than the others we have tried: Norton Ghost 10.0, Norton Ghost 14.0, Norton 360, DT Utilities' PC Backup Pro, or the native Windows XP and Windows Vista backup programs. Genie does what you tell it to, unlike Norton Ghost which has a fit because it missed one day's scheduled incremental backup or Windows Vista's native backup which will only restore the computer to the way it was when the backup was made and therefore requires the same size hard drives partitioned into volumes exactly the same way (sort of a joke because by the time a good hard drive wears out you find they do not make them that small anymore so you can not replace it with an identical hard drive!).",0

"I am a long time user of Photoshop Lightroom, from the first version. I used to use Photoshop to manage and edit digital images, but switched to LR totally from then. LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.

Well, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.

If you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video. But if you want more like publishing, converting and optimizing images, I recommend this training video.",0

"I've used Norton before and various free anti-virus, and with a professional version you get a more comprehensive set of security options that quietly takes care of business in the back ground.  There is a peace of mind factor that a professional version gives you, and for the less than tech savvy it's a bit more idiot proof than a bare bones free ware.  I have no problem with free ware, as my computing needs are pretty simple, but a pro version is very nice and this is pretty cheap for the year long comfort of install it and then pretty much forget about it security.  I got this current product via the Vine, but I have bought the professional 360 Norton for the two years running previously when it has been on sale.

What ever level you are on, this program will be helpful to you.",0
"I have used other Rosetta Stone programs and really like the teaching method they use. Each lesson introduces new words and phrases, which are repeated in different ways. The repetition makes it easy to retain the language lessons. The lessons progress in a logical way, so each builds on what has come before.

There were no technical problems for me in installing this program on my laptop running Windows XP. Installation takes a long time (it's a big program), but it worked perfectly. The headset is somewhat flimsy, but it works. Do turn the volume down VERY low before you start the program, or the sound will blast you out of your chair.

Rosetta Stone allows a lot of customization. For example, you can choose to learn reading and writing, speaking and listening, or reading, writing, speaking and listening. You can also choose how precise you want the voice recognition to be, so you can make it easier or more difficult.

The Audio Companion CDs do not seem very useful to me. They do not contain English translations, so their only purpose would be to listen to the pronunciation as a review.

The Rosetta Stone program is one of the best ways I have found to learn a new language. I had considered the intensive language program offered by a local college, but spending an entire week in a classroom would be hard to work in to my schedule. The Rosetta Stone lessons can be done on my schedule, at my convenience. Of course, you do need to work the lessons regularly so that you retain what you learned in the previous lessons and just because of the volume of information presented.

If you have tried other language programs without success, Rosetta Stone could work for you. Although the course includes listening and repeating, it is more interactive and interesting that those old language courses on cassettes or vinyl albums.",0
"I used Norton 360 for years and this is apparently the evolution of that software.  I now have it on all of my Windows computers and my Android cellphone.

I can't pay my bills easily without the password vault that keeps all of my passwords memorized and protected.  I have never found 1 password that makes all systems happy.  They have different requirements that some have to be 14 characters long but others are only 7, some need symbols, and others can't have symbols.  Its confusing but with this, I do just remember 1 password, the password for my vault.  If I actually need to see it I just log into my vault and then go to the details on that login.

I haven't ever had any problems with viruses in my life but I've run Norton most of my life so I don't think that's a coincidence.  I've gotten notification of things blocked or quarantined but never had any major problems so I trust Norton.

With all of the threats today it is more and more important to use good anti-virus software.",0

"It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support -- Limited PDF support in Home/Student Edition

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  The more expensive version of WordPerfect handles PDF files and will import text and graphic based PDF files and will perform optical character recognition on the PDF file.  As the comment below shows, Corel indicates this version does not open PDF files, although it will publish to PDF.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Although it is not perfect, WordPerfect converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is extremely powerful.  It is just that like most M/S software, it does too much and takes the control away from the user.  It is also unfamiliar to me because the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  Accordingly, I prefer to use WordPerfect and save the output as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph. If you want to change one paragraph, you can do it with a single keystroke (the WordPerfect 6 keystrokes are F4 for left indent or Shift-F4 for double indent).

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] codes and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. For example, once I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!

One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.

As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

"Autodesk SketchBook Pro 2010 is quality paint/drawing software designed for use with a graphic tablet and pen.  However it will also work with a conventional mouse but getting quality results is more difficult that way.

I installed in on a Windows XP SP3 computer along with a Bamboo Tablet/Pen and it works smoothly and with no problems.  I also tried it on a Vista Laptop but unfortunately Vista 64 bit is not supported yet so please take note.

The program is excellent, the interface is easy to use and with a flick of your pen you can access the many features including pencils, brushes, markers, layers and pan/zoom tools.

This software is so good that even people who have little drawing ability can soon get great results.  I would claim to be average at drawing but this program is so versatile and intuitive that I can get excellent results at times. It also increases my workflow because of the processing speed and easy accessibility of all the features.

It is difficult to compare it to other programs.  Sure there are other paint programs like Photoshop or Painter but nothing compares to the ease and flexibility of using this program and at $100 it is a fraction of the price of other drawing programs.

If you still want to use Photoshop, then draw with this one and enhance your picture with Photoshop.  This will save in most formats; it uses layered TIF images but it will also open/save BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG files and PSD files for use in Adobe Photoshop.

I highly recommend this software, it doesn't need much selling because it is already award winning and used by a stream of respectable computer artists and designers.  All I can say is that if you have artistic ambitions and want a good program to enhance them then it is well worth a look at.",0
Can't get it to install on any of my windows computers.,1
"Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well:
1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system.

2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN.
Look at this comparison
Windows XP Professional  Size on drive 1.5 gig  Memory requirements 128 MB

Windows Vista  Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG!

If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)

 What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory!

This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",0
"As a kid, I really found this game to be quite dull. But now that I'm older, I find myself really attached to it. I think what I disliked is that there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of running around and learning. Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending). And really, the learning isn't all that bad.

I appreciate the characters more now, and the ending. I love the ending. Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.

However, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch. If you want a learning heavy game as your intro, I'd say go for Scarlet Hand, just be prepared as it's ending is a little scary.",0
"Upgraded to 8.1, worked great, not sure why people dislike 8 so much, it has been very stable and my friends love that I have tablet games now.

"As if the 2-day shipping and Netflix-style streaming service wasn't enough value for money, Amazon went and added this. I'm very impressed. There's a good selection of all kind of music which is updated and added to constantly. The music streams and downloads wonderfully. Be aware, if you aren't already, that even if you download music onto your phone, you won't be able to play it if Amazon removes it from the available music. That's only happened to me three times in several months, and the ever-expanding catalogue more than makes up for it. It's a fantastic value for money.",0
"The progress is low-priced video editing programs over the past few years is nothing less than astounding. Originally, Corel acquired what has become VideoStudio Pro X2 from Ulead. Ulead's products were always ambitious and often too quirky to use. In this case, Corel has tamed the base product and turned out a very usable video editing and DVD authoring package that compares very favorably with the stalwart Adobe Premiere Elements.

  One big advantage packed into the VideoStudio Pro  X2 box is a manual, a real manual!  While the 200+ page manual will not teach you the art of editing, it will most certainly walk you through, albeit briefly in most cases, eery significant feature of the program. It's a matter of opinion, but I think old-fashioned ink on paper is still the best way to rapidly convey information. Kudos to Corel for including the manual, something Adobe doesn't bother to do.

  And there is a lot to learn  about VideoStudio Pro X2. This is no lightweight editing program: it can do (within reason) anything you need done by way of video capture, editing and output.

  Video capture options include DV tape and AVCHD.

  You start with three video and three audio tracks, a lot for a product in this price range. You can add up to five overlay tracks, which is actually a staggering number for a consumer oriented package. You can, of course, add effects, filters, overlays and titles. There is an abundance of trimming and cutting tools, which you can apply on the frame level.

  The list of things you can do, as a matter of fact, is quite extensive and you will be glad to have that 200+ page manual to work with as you learn the program.

  The work area is quite nice and you can change the view to meet your needs and desires.

  You can create your own animations with a painting tool, generate your own titles, edit audio complete with a mixing panel.

  Output options are surprisingly rich. DVDs with menus, of course, the now ubiquitous YouTube uploader, write to DV tape and export to mobile device.

  For those of us who have roots in the days of editing film with the then conventional tools, VideoStudio Pro X2 with its low price and broaqd usability is breathtaking. In comparison with other contemporary consumer editing programs, though, it is a contender for best of breed.

  Overall, it represents excellent value and a comprehensive toolkit for turning your raw video into a finished product.

"I've been a TurboTax user for many years, and the 2011 version continues the positive experiences I've had in the past. Installation on a PC running Windows XP (SP3) was uneventful. It took about 15 minutes start to finish, including the time to download an update from their website.

No problems pulling in last years Turbo Tax return. That's a big feature for me, since as a business owner, I have to deal with issues such as depreciation schedules. Plus, it's always helpful to see the totals for each line item from last year to make sure I didn't forget something.

I use the Deluxe version and it offers everything I need for dealing with investments and my business (Schedule C). Turbo Tax continues to try to up-sell me into the business version, but the Deluxe gives me everything needed at a lower cost.

The menu system is clear and easy to use, and the software also allows a form view so you can jump to a specific form or line item.

I'm sure other tax software works just as well, and offers the benefit of a lower cost. I stick with TurboTax mainly because it always has worked well for me, and I just prefer to stick with what I know will work. Plus, I'm concerned there would be problems pulling in the prior year's return when it was prepared with a different package.

I can't say it makes paying taxes fun, but it certainly takes the sting out of dealing with all the rules, regs, and paperwork. I'll be buying it again next year.",0
"This router works like a charm and I cannot get my hands off this one. I needed a router to practice for my CCNA and CCNP and decided to look online for a place to get a good router; Amazon was great and this store was awesome.

"While I have yet to need this for its intended purpose, it has provided me peace of mind when traveling with my laptop.

"This is a robust mapping program that goes beyond&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2009/dp/B001EHXOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009</a>to add features such as the ability to input data from Excel or Access.

It creates clear driving directions that can be emailed as a picture or as an attachment.  The map (either as an attachment or as a picture in the email) is high quality and easy to read.  The email with map and directions was only about 260KB

Another great feature is you can customize fuel cost and MPG city/highway to get fuel cost estimates for the routes that are being planned

Another handy feature is the ability to turn a map into a web page then easily integrates it into your site with either a simple web creator or one such as Front Page or Dreamweaver.

This is probably much more robust than what I needed but it will serve me well being able to email customized directions to my home office for my clients.  In the future I may use it as a tool to map where my clients are located and perhaps develop some marketing tools.

If you are looking for a more robust mapping program to intergrate with data this could very well be the ticket.  If you are just looking for some good mapping program consider Microsoft Streets and Trips.",0

"VideoStudio competes with Cyberlink PowerDirector, Pinnacle Studio, Sony Movie Studio and Adobe Premier Elements.  I have used the Cyberlink, Pinnacle and Adobe products.  You can find my previous reviews of these in my review history.  Corel is competing hard with these other companies to win your business, and has come up with several new features in this X6 version that the others do not (yet) have.

Motion Tracking:  You can select a part of a frame to 'lock' a word or other object to, and the object will move through the frame with the selection you made, like 'Adobe After Effects' does.  This is handy for simple things like a thought/text bubble following a person, a description or title for an object in a frame as you pan, or a PIP effect that moves with the subject in the movie (think Teletubbies TV effect on their 'screen', or tracking a hockey puck on the ice).  You can add multiple trackers in one clip.  By the way, the tracker information is stored with the clip, so if you use that same clip in multiple projects, you don't have to re-create your motion tracking.

Customize Motion:  You can now move things like titles, PIP, still images or other objects over the frame with keyframes.

Screen Capture enhancement:  I use this feature instead of something like Camtasia.  Corel has increased frame rates on screen capture from the 15 fps that it used to be, and now allows you to select 25 and 30 fps also.  This should make higher-motion screen captures smoother, and bring it closer to ""Camtasia Quality"".

Ultra HD:  4K Ultra HD is now available, if you can use it.  You will need some higher-end recording and playback equipment to make full use of this though.  Also, render times are much longer for this format.

Stop Motion enhancement:  You can now do stop motion photography directly with your Canon DSLR camera connected to the computer.  VideoStudio shows several camera settings like shutter, exposure, ISO, photo quality, etc.  Before you could only use your webcam of DirectX type device.

Subtitles with voice detection:  You use the usual narration feature to record a voice track for your video.  Then, in the subtitle editor, you can scan the voice track and it will create subtitle sequences based on when you pause in your narration.  You then must still type in the subtitle text or import from a subtitle file.  But the work of creating the subtitle objects at the proper timecodes is done for you.  Now... a voice *recognition* feature (voice-to-text) would be cool in a future version.  ;-)

Of the additional items you get with the ""Ultimate"" version, the included Boris Graffiti v6.1 makes an upgrade even more compelling if you do title animation like type on text, text on a path, jitter and randomization.

So there are several new features that make this version of VideoStudio compelling as an upgrade from X5 and previous.  The screen capture alone makes it useful to me.  Still, I like my Cyberlink PowerDirector for its more organized and intuitive user interface, and its quicker render time.  However for now, I may create some clips in VS X6 and use them in PowerDirector if I want the Motion Tracking or Custom Motion features.",0

It found a break in one of my cables I didn't even know about!  Well, didn't know about until it failed to link at 1Gb/s anyways...)

This switch is fill gig, supports an SFP, and is small.  From the pictures you may think it is rack sized by its proportions, but it is only about 1"" tall in reality.  It also has a serial connection.  I haven't used it yet, but it is very nice to know it is there in case I botch up the settings.

I did find the vlan settings convoluted.  I had a heck of time getting traffic tagged properly on the SFP.  However, I think this was exacerbated by the fact that I haven't migrated off PVID 1 yet.  Read the manual before configuring 802.1Q on it.  The switch I got had 3com firmware which is very different from HP ProCurve firmware.",0

"I've been using the service on and off for years so I've got a long, though not expert background in their software.  The thing I used to hate about them was the interface of their software.  Their databases were awesome, but the software left much to be desired.  About five years or so ago they redesigned their software suite.  At first the improved interface was beset with a lot of teething problems.  I stayed away for a few years and finally came back last year and picked up the 2011 version.  That was a HUDGE leap forward over what I was used too.  Better interface, better web integration, better features.

I got the chance to try out the 2012 version so I decided to give it a try.  So far I don't see a lot of changes from 2011.  I just recently tried the iPhone app.  That was clever, and I've used it a few times to look up something during a lunch conversation, but I don't see it being of real use to me.  If you find yourself in the library a lot this would probably be a great way to update information.

So if you've got an old version of FTM then I say go for the upgrade.  If you've got the 2011 version then I don't see a big reason to make the leap.",0

"I love trend products, and this one is no exception.  They work, they make sense, they don't do weird things, and they don't inexplicably crash over and over.  The protection is apparently good too--I've never been infected when using Trend, which I can't say about the 2 big names...you know the ones they stick you with ""trial versions"" of when you buy your new computers?

Trend products are really rock solid, and I swear by them.  This is the same thing I recommended for my mother, who isn't tech-savvy at all, as well as any friends who are shopping for AV & antispyware products.  Trend is the name you want to see on YOUR computer.

AV software is supposed to work in the background, with minimal user input.  It's supposed to protect my computer, 24 hours a day, each and every day, without crashing or conflicting with my OS or other software.  I don't want to have a personal relationship with my AV software...I just want it to WORK.  I also don't want it to fail because someone hits a key allowing my computer to be infected with crap, so it has to be efficient without continual input from me or anyone walking by my computer.  Trend delivers, and I swear by it.",0
"Sony ""Vegas Pro 8"" is simply one of the best high-end video editing software on the market. The package includes Vegas Pro 8 and DVD Architect Pro 4.5. (Update 1/3/2009: Vegas Pro 8 users can update to DVD Architect Pro 5 for free, providing Blu-Ray support).

We have produced over 20 instruction videos using Vegas (starting with Vegas 4) and could not be happier with the results. Every step from capturing the footage off our Mini-DV Canon GL2 Camcorder to authoring the master DVD is a smooth process.

Here are some general observations:

* The interface has a nice layout right out of the box, but is also easily customized to suite your personal editing habits
* The included plugins are top notch and compare nicely with some of the high dollar add ons for Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects
* Easier to use and learn than Adobe Premiere Pro
* Unlimited Video and Audio Tracks
* Great interactive tutorials are actually useful
* Great chromakey (greenscreen) functionality

"I was very skeptical about this offer, but I did not want to pay a yearly fee just to get updates, after a lot of analysis of other sellers, I decided to take a chance on the most competitive offer.
As it happened everything went reasonably smoothly and I have just what I want i.e. Word, Excel and Powerpoint, provided Microsoft does not try and get more money out of me after the first year this will suffice for another 4-5 years. I don't know how all of this works, but have assumed that it is a genuine offer, and on that basis it can only be a win win solution. The only drawback is no disk, however that seems to be the case with all Microsoft products.",0
"I choose the online download to monitor the process.  I did a downoad and expect this to work with improving my computer.  After the installation, I downloated the Norton Eraser which locates bad files, etc. reveals the status and next I did a Remove or Repair.  What occurs is removing items that are at risk, then, it will do a remove or repair.  What the Create System Restore Point does is remove the risks.

Next, I downloaded the Boot Recovery.  Not sure when this is beneficial, but to be safe, I downloaded it in case I have trouble. The instructions and prompts provide easy maneuvering.  That is a critical role as maneuvering is critical for success.  Set up was good, quick, easy.

This promises to do a lot to protect my computer.  Time will tell and I have not had enough indication to determine whether it has made a great improvement.  Mostly, we all want security and protection for out computers.

Will update as I determine the condition and performance of this Norton Antivirus addition.  Rizzo",0

"I have been a norton antivirus user for over 10 years. Though i use other products in addition, this is my go base line of defense. I don't know what changed this year, but usually when I bought Norton for Amazon, the price was great but the install was awful. This year the install went so smoothly, I could not believe how fast it was done. I love the fact that the 10 devise is cheaper than the 5 devise, which gives me plenty of room to cover my 4 computers plus other devises. Norton would be what I would recommend every time.",0
"I have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I have found it easy to use.  I don't usually skip sections.  Just easier for me to go through each section.  No problem importing my data from the prior year.  A long while back I switched to another product because of calculations errors Turbo Tax made and while it guarantees the calculations it was such a hassle to prove to them it wasn't worth it so I switched.  I came back a few years later and there was no issue importing my data from a competing product.

I like the guided menus.  And this year's product seems to be just as easy to use and helpful.  This Premier product does offer features that use.  It may be more than others may need like stocks and bonds, for instance.

While it comes with one state download, it does not include a state e-file.  That gets to be expensive.  As is buying another state download which I need to do.  I have had issues with e-filing my resident state because Intuit did not include a copy of the other state return which is a requirement.  So I don't e-file and mail it in.  They said they would fix that, but I haven't seen anything that says they did.

All in all I like this product and it makes my life much easier.  I remember the days of taking pen to the 1040 and other forms and using a calculator... talk about stress.  I recommend this particular edition if you need the financial guidance for your investments.  Otherwise try a less expensive version.  You should find it very easy and intuitive.",0
"Other than the start button, It runs better than Windows 7, and Windows 7 ran real good.
I got the start button added back in thru a computer utility ""Advanced system care 6"" free edition. I use the start button only because of habit and I do find it a bit faster than the tiles in 8's start screen.  I am sure at some point I will outgrow it.

I did the upgrade option this time (from 7) and not a clean install as I usually have done.  I was surprised that it went very smooth and lost no data.  I did back up everything prior to the install. Only one program had to be reinstalled because of functioning. Saved a ton of time on reinstalling everything. The upgrade will even leave your desktop as you have it in 7.
Microsoft just keeps getting better at Windows upgrade process. This one is down to a science..

Windows 8 also cleaned up a problem I was having with IE 10 on 7 which MS upgraded and then updated. Flash player was not working after the update and print was scrambled on some parts of printed matter. I found the same problem on fire fox.

Boot time seems faster with Windows 8.

If you are hooked on the start button and refuse to upgrade because of this, Upgrade to 8 and install  the utility I mentioned (free edition) and have your ""start button"" and Windows 8 your way!

Windows 8 is a great upgrade and on the surface it is much the same as Windows 7 once you get the ""start"" button back in.",0
"Autodesk SketchBook Pro 2010 is quality paint/drawing software designed for use with a graphic tablet and pen.  However it will also work with a conventional mouse but getting quality results is more difficult that way.

I installed in on a Windows XP SP3 computer along with a Bamboo Tablet/Pen and it works smoothly and with no problems.  I also tried it on a Vista Laptop but unfortunately Vista 64 bit is not supported yet so please take note.

The program is excellent, the interface is easy to use and with a flick of your pen you can access the many features including pencils, brushes, markers, layers and pan/zoom tools.

This software is so good that even people who have little drawing ability can soon get great results.  I would claim to be average at drawing but this program is so versatile and intuitive that I can get excellent results at times. It also increases my workflow because of the processing speed and easy accessibility of all the features.

It is difficult to compare it to other programs.  Sure there are other paint programs like Photoshop or Painter but nothing compares to the ease and flexibility of using this program and at $100 it is a fraction of the price of other drawing programs.

If you still want to use Photoshop, then draw with this one and enhance your picture with Photoshop.  This will save in most formats; it uses layered TIF images but it will also open/save BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG files and PSD files for use in Adobe Photoshop.

I highly recommend this software, it doesn't need much selling because it is already award winning and used by a stream of respectable computer artists and designers.  All I can say is that if you have artistic ambitions and want a good program to enhance them then it is well worth a look at.",0

"When I saw Quicken WillMaker 2013 I didn't know everything that was involved with estate planning. That's where the plus comes in. With WillMaker I was able to create many documents that will help before I move on from this life. These include my living will, heath-care directive, and limited power of attorney.

I have to admit that it took a while for me to get around to creating a will and doing estate planning. I guess it just made that reality of life a little too real to me. When I did WillMaker plus made the process easier than I expected. It was effectively painless.

I didn't use the support - but other reviews provide glowing reviews which I suspect are founded based on the well thought-out software.

This is a good DIY tool for straightforward estate planning: probably 90+ percent of estates. It probably gets a good start on much more complicated planning that will requires a visit to legal office. The head start that WillMaker Plus could provide in paperwork and organization may save hundreds or thousands in legal fees compared to going in with nothing.",0

I recommend sitting down with your child to discover what can be done and how to explore with this eBook prior to letting them explore on their own.  Kids are great at discovering things on their own, but will get more out of it if they fully understand what they can do with the eBook.

I've got a 3 year old and a 6 year old, and the younger prefers the Read to Me, while the older prefers the Read With Me as he is learning to read in Kindergarten.

LOVE this new eBook offering from LeapFrog!",0

"I've been using it for the last 1 year and enjoyed this antenna.

"I stress-tested this product by purchasing 1,000 ft of CAT5e stranded UTP cable and connecting both ends using RJ-11 connectors and just one pair of copper conductor.  Although the manufacturer recommends solid copper telephone wires, I thought I'd give it a shot anyways.  The results were impressive.  I got 50 Mbps on the other side and a SpeedTest.net test confirms the same internet speed I get when using my local Giganet LAN (i.e. around 30 Mbps).  Highly recommended product, principally if you need to take a ride on an unused pair of telephone wires to extend a LAN. Bravo B&B.",0
"I'm not a professional accountant - but I do my own accounting, for myself & wife (3 different companies).

I've used 3 different versions of Quickbooks in the past, but not in the last few years, & I've never tried the Quickbooks Online. I've always found the Peachtree/Sage products more intuitive, and this is no exception.

In terms of features, the Sage 50 can handle our 3 different businesses just fine (in fact it's overkill for us). However, the payroll & credit card functions are optional add-ons (which, for the asking price of this software, is a bit disappointing). You can do payroll manually for no extra charge (old-school style, you have to look up tax rates yourself).

If you're undecided, the big question is how you're going to use it. You might opt for Quickbooks if...
* You are doing larger companies
* You would like different users to be able to login
* You would like remote access
* Or if you want full payroll service

And if you're just not sure what you want, you can try before you buy. Both Quickbooks Online & the Sage web site have instructions for free trials.

Also, there is a ""light"" version of Quickbooks (the cheapest one right is $9.99 per month I believe, with the ""full"" version at $50 per month, and various levels in between). Finally, if you're just an individual or mom/pop business, you might be able to find free software or apps such as MINT, which basically just track your expenses & investments in one place, but it's worth mentioning.

Good luck!",0
"This unit is much faster and more powerful that Trendnets other access points, but it comes at about double the price.
I had tested two of the TEW-653AP that were needed to cover the desired area of use with no dead spots. Ended up replacing both of those with one of these access points.
Very pleased with the results.
I had originally considered the Trendnet TEW-653AP but the lack of features for modern high speed needs left that one out of the running. Speed of 300mbps vs 600 mbps.
I needed the extended power rating along with gigabit ethernet WAN ports that this unit has. Also wanted the 5gb ability that the TEW 653 did not offer.

"I've long promoted AVG's free products to friends who asked my opinions. I've tried them myself, and they provide an acceptable level of service- great news, considering the price. However, after a terrible experience with a well-known security product several years ago (see my other reviews for details), I swore off all security programs, deciding instead to be vigilant with my machines and my internet activities as a better way to protect my machines. Recently, though, I've tried several new products, and haven't had any major issues with any of them (though there have been some minor frustrations- see below). AVG Internet Security 2011 is the best I've seen, though, by far.

After test-driving Norton 360 on my 'junk' machine, and being frustrated with the way it tends to make decisions FOR the user, instead of giving the user options on how to handle potential threats, I was hoping to find a product that would be equally vigilant in detecting potential issues without taking the machine over. AVG Internet Security 2011 does just that. As you may know, some programs register 'false-positives' with security software- they are safe programs, but they exhibit some characteristics that trigger suspicion. That's fine- if my security software thinks there may be a threat, I want to know about it. However, some security software (like Norton) take the initiative of deleting or quarantining automatically, and this can be very frustrating. AVG engages the user at every juncture, presenting options to clean, delete, or make exemptions for such software. This is very helpful.

More generally, AVG runs silently, it doesn't use up a lot of resources, and its notification system is great- notices are displayed as corner pop-ups that don't distract, but are easy to review if desired. I never really had any issues before I got AVG, and haven't had any since, but it's great to know I'm protected without having to sacrifice performance or worry about the program doing something I don't want it to without my knowledge.

In brief, AVG Internet Security 2011 is a sound investment, and the fact that customer service is available makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the free versions. Highly recommended for anyone looking for effective, non-intrusive security for their PC.",0
"I am using this antenna with a pair of Linksys WAP54G wireless APs, one acting as a repeater.  The main unit has a 1 watt amplifier hooked to this antenna, the repeater had nothing.

"This Vehicle Tracker from AwareGPS is a fantastic tool for parents of new or inexperienced drivers, as well as for businesses who want to keep track of fleet vehicles.

It's about as simple as it gets. Install the free AwareGPS app on your smartphone, set up your account and then plug the small device into the OBD port on your car (generally located underneath the dash below and to the left of the steering wheel. The port is keyed so it can only plug in one way.) That's it. The device instantly sends info to your smart phone concerning where the car has driven and at what time, whether or not the driver was speeding and by how many miles over the limit, how much gas is in the tank, whether the battery is functioning properly, if the device has been removed, etc. You can also follow your car's movements real time.

This is brilliant! Not only does it let you, the parent and car owner, keep tabs on your car, it lets the driver see his/her ""report card"" and helps them become better drivers (hopefully.) It would also be excellent for when deadbeat relatives want to borrow your car ""to run to the convenience store""...

It would make it very simple to track a car that has been stolen, too. This is something I really like since I live in a large city and actually had my car stolen some years ago. I hope I never need it for this purpose but I'm glad it's there.

The service costs $19.99/mo and you can start and stop service as needed with no penalties because there is no contract.

"The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October. If you are updating from Leopard, Apple has continued to make it inexpensive for a family using more than one machine by pricing the upgrade at about $10.00 a machine (assuming you use all five). Not bad.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!",0

"Norton = absolutely reliable.

As a longtime Mac user, Norton has always been my most reliable source for internet security and for utilities.  Even though Macs have generally been free from any kind of malware - unless you do something to get it--it is still good to be able to scan and check for mistakes.  Because of my work and research, I sometimes have to use a PC to work.  As my PC does relatively little else than scan and follow research databases and log into my secure work site, imagine my surprise when Norton identified 430 errors, only 429 of which were fixable.

I've been trying to track down that last one to no avail.

"Yes, what took me about half an hour last year from download, install and data entry is still not done after at least six times that long and I am ANGRY. I am trying to create 1099s, a simple programming function compared to the rest of the tax needs I am going to have as I prepare our full taxes and THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK. 1099 and W-2 is now forced to be online and the system is horrible, doesn't work and each successful data entry takes at least three attempts. And then you aren't sure if it is successful because instead of freezing your computer, you get this message:

Houston, we have a problem...
Luckily, we're not in space. Rest assured, our programmers are on it.

That may work if you sign out, sign in and try that again.
If you see this again, please contact us so we can help.

I am not amused. NASA wouldn't have ever gotten to the moon with TurboTax 2011 Software. They'd never gotten to the launchpad. Or the rocket built. We'd still think it was made of swiss cheese.

Then, of course, when you go back and try again, your data is often correct--after all you just entered a four digit number! Why would that break a system?

So, yes, believe the reviews. I haven't even started the individual tax return and I am worried. I might be buying TaxAct or whatever I can find before this tax season is over because my trust level is kaput. I could do 1099s online at the IRS site or handwrite them, they are the easiest, simplest form I will deal with over the next few months. But I bought TurboTax to make it even easier. And if it can't handle these, well, I shudder and I worry.

And if you are in the same boat as me and bought early before the reviews and WANT to try this anyway, well, the functionality is slightly better in Google Chrome over IE 8. Not much but at least I got a file to transfer on my sixth attempt on Chrome. So my names were imported from last year's file. Never mind that it said it didn't and then it transferred the file twice and now won't let me delete the duplicates without that lovely Houston message I shared above. I finally got one to delete after 8 attempts. I may not be so lucky with the rest of them.

So yes. Crap. Utter, useless crap. I want a refund but it is software so that's not possible since I've ripped open the box and loaded this simulation of a tax preparer.

This is my 9th year using TurboTax and by far the worst experience I have ever had with it. Phooey on Intuit.

UPDATE on 1/31/12:

After countless attempts at data entry in the online 1099/W2 Reporter system, I finally got my 8 1099s completed. It took me 6 hours of repeated attempts to get the data entered. Yes, I was foolish. I could have done it somewhere else in less than an hour. Then I read in another review here that there is a backend way to do the reports through the software.

Click FILE in the upper left hand corner menu and select NEW TAX RETURN and the selection like previous years. For kicks and giggles I decided to do that after finally printing up and mailing the 1099s today, a few days past when I intended. The whole process took me 15 minutes, what it has done in previous years. Why did Turbo Tax not give us the outright option? Why did they release extremely flawed online software? (Even selecting a state doesn't work in the drop down boxes unless you hit a hard enter after selecting, otherwise it clears out the field when you move to the next one. Nevermind the inability to process submitted info, the forms can't even handle data entry such as 5 digit only zip codes, etc.)

So this is too little too late for me and for you, but perhaps someone will be saved the headache.

And do save that return for the 1099/W2s in the software (the work around) because even though you save it, it doesn't not come up as an option for your ongoing working returns in the open file page. You have to browse for it on your computer--know where you saved it!--if you need to access it again.

"I was a Mac user until I used Windows 7.

I've owned several Macs running OS X, including the late 2008 aluminum MacBook. Thanks to Boot Camp, I was able to run Windows on my Mac, and when the opportunity to try the Windows 7 Release Candidate came up, I decided to use my Boot Camp partition for just that.

It ran great. I was impressed. After a few months, I found myself spending more time in the Windows 7 partition than in the OS X partition. I finally decided to swap around my partition sizes, and gave Windows 7 the larger chunk of my hard drive, while OS X was re-installed fresh and left unused on a tiny partition. I didn't miss OS X, which is interesting because I've spent many years defending OS X, and countering PC users when they bashed Macs. Still, I was a Mac user. I had Mac hardware. I was certain it was a good value anyway.

Some online friends proved me wrong on that count, too. They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too. I couldn't deny it: I was clinging to my Mac out of brand loyalty, and with Windows 7 on the horizon (and the RC working so well) I could see no reason why I shouldn't switch to PC.

So I did. I sold my aluminum MacBook and picked up an ASUS gaming PC. I removed Windows Vista from the ASUS and installed the Windows 7 RC as my primary operating system, and was pretty happy with it. It ran smoothly and without incident for many months while I waited for the retail release of Windows 7.

Just yesterday I got my copy of Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade, and I have to say that installation went well. I was up & running in less than an hour, and had my previous Windows Backup restored to my new OS within another 40 minutes. I did have to spend a little time re-downloading some things like Firefox and Thunderbird, but those things are to be expected with a fresh install. The cool thing is that Windows 7 remembered that the RC I was running was an ""upgrade"" from a legitimate Windows Vista installation, and so I wasn't bugged, prompted, or tasked with proving my ownership of Vista. It just *knew* and went ahead with the installation.

Once installed, activation was simple and took a few seconds online. You need not fear MS activation now, as they're a lot less touchy than they were when Windows XP first showed up.

So what do I like about Windows 7? On a really basic level, I like that I can play Direct X games, where the Mac was a little short in the gaming department. But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment. Sidebar gadgets are nice, too. Windows also did a good job ripping off the ""Sticky Notes"" application from the Mac, and I use that quite a bit.

The big negative for most people in switching to Windows 7 will be the lack of an email client. For me it's no big deal because I use Mozilla Thunderbird (free and open-source). For people used to Windows Mail or Outlook Express, you'll either have to switch clients, or make a purchase.

Best of all, Windows 7 is not a resource hog. I gained a lot of performance going from Vista (the original OS in my ASUS laptop) to Windows 7 RC, and the retail release is no different. Things work better, and Windows 7 takes advantage of my 4GB of RAM. It helps to be running 64-bit, though. It's a good thing Microsoft included both 64-bit and 32-bit DVDs in the case. No mail-in upgrades, here!

If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that. After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC.",0

"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",0

"This update has been a long time coming, but worth the wait.  One of the most basic improvements is that you can now run Microsoft office native on the Intel based Macs.  This improves on speed, especially when you have many applications open.  Support for previous versions of MS-Office is very good, even better than the Windows version in some cases.  I like the multiple floating palettes.  It allows me to organize commonly used functions better than in previous versions.",0
This may be Trend's best security product yet! Installation was a breeze and progressed without a problem upgrading from Trend Internet Secuirty 2010. The new cloud based Trend Protect network solution is light on system resources and seems to run great. The interface is simplified and very clean although advanced users may be a bit underwelmed. All in all I am very happy to be sticking with Trend and for the price it is hard to beat.,0
"I've used the full version of Corel Painter for years and it's one of my favorite packages for digital art, especially when using a Wacom Tablet. The power of the full version is a bit too much for many people, but Painter Essentials is accurately named: it captures the essential piece of Painter and allows an artist that's new to digital art or that doesn't want to learn a bunch of menus to create something beautiful.

The user interface is very intuitive and has quite a few features from the full version, but with a greatly simplified interface. The selection of brushes isn't quite as rich as with the full version, but it's very powerful at its price point.

One thing many may like are the tools for creating art from a photograph. The workflow is very easy and lets you have some fun with your photos. The mirror image tool is fun, but the most popular tool for my kids is the auto paint mode. You import a photograph, choose a style, and the program takes over. It's kind of interesting to watch, but it's not very fast. Once the auto paint has finished, you can edit the results.

Overall, I think this is a nice tool for someone who's getting into digital art, but I recommend using a tablet instead of a mouse since a digitizing pen lets you move much more naturally.",0

"My experience with this product is primarily on iPod Touch devices. In total, I've installed the Hotspot Privacy on three iPod Touch devices. The install is really simple: just download and run the program, then follow the onscreen prompts. After completion the Settings app will have an additional option to turn on/off VPN.

Typically this product would be utilized to obtain a secure connection, although through my experience it appears to include an additional benefit. For reasons beyond my understanding, I've actually encountered better network performance with the VPN on in many cases. On one trip in particular that I went on, everybody in my group was able to log onto a hotel's network but were unable to use the internet. Once I turned the VPN on I was able to use the internet, while the remainder of my group was still unable to use it.

In summary, this product is easy to install and use and may, as in my case, actually improve your overall network performance in some scenarios.",0
"For me, the LeapFrog Leap Pad is a great learning toy for children and the games are a huge part of it! This cute Sesame Street game is aimed at preschoolers, but works for all three of my kid testers who range from ages 4, 6, and 7.  The other games we own are more literacy based so this Solve it with Elmo, Abby and Super Grover game for the Leap Pad is great because it focus on 'STEM', which stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics  concepts.

As far as if this kept the attention of my kid testers, I believe it did! They picked up the gist of the game pretty quick and seemed entertained.  I personally like this game because of the fun ways it tries to teach STEM and the cute graphics.

If your kid likes Sesame Street, they'll probably like LeapFrog game!",0
"The Rosetta Stone program is truly ingenious.  I have spent the last two months using the program and the amount you can learn in that time is by far superior to memorization or learning from a book.  Rosetta Stone works the same way you learn your first language - without translation memorization.  It seems a little repetitive as you go along, but when you realize how much you remember without any prompting or memorization, it's truly amazing.  I just returned from a trip to Italy and the program helped me communicate, and perhaps more importantly, really taught me the fundamentals of the language and pronunciation.  Therefore, I could look up a word in a small phrasebook if needed, and feel confident when speaking to locals.  I highly recommend the Rosetta Stone program for those who want to learn a new language.  The fact that the headphones will listen to you and confirm if you are using correct inflection and pronunciation is very helpful in giving you the confidence to begin using your newly learned language in the real world.",0

"I am a video novice, with a camera that will take videos that do not work and play well with Microsofts movie software.  I turned for help to Corels VideoStudio 7, and got the flexibility I was looking for.  Just as I was beginning to get reasonably comfortable with its features, I found VideoStudio Pro 8 and X8 Ultimate.

Ultimate X8 has all the features of Pro 8 and all the benefits Ive come to expect from Corel, but for only a few more dollars, Ultimate X8 has 10 add-ons that are well worth considering before you make a purchase decision.

I have several favorites among the 10 add-ons, especially Audio ducking.  Now I can use background music without drowning out voice-over effects.  Also, I like the titling add-on where I can make transparent titles for very interesting effects.

Corel provides tutorials for each of their add-ons in Ultimate X8.  I have not finished viewing or practicing all of them, but, based on the tutorials I have used, I deem their quality outstanding.  I will eventually see all of them because there will be features pointed out that I was unaware existed.

Fun to use with excellent tutorials to make you look like an expert!  I cant ask for more than VideoStudio Ultimate X8.  And the price won't break your budget  most reasonable for all thats packed into this package.

"I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.  Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses ""screen real-estate"" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.
However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.
And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.  The backup feature is excellent as well!!
My hats off to Microsoft for another great product!!",0
"As long time user of Dragon, I fully endorse the product.  It's great!  This version is no different.  But you don't necessarily have to spend $200 or need the latest and greatest.

But as a long time user of Dragon, the updates aren't exactly mind blowing.  The Dragon toolbar, the better integration with apps, etc. is all fine and good but it's just slight.  The only compelling reason I've found is that the Windows 8 computer seems to work better somewhat.  But if you're using Dragon 12 on Windows 8 fine then you probably aren't using the features that you'd notice.

If you're totally new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking, it's an excellent piece of software that will translate your words into text.  The newest versions even allow mouse control.  (I know that 12 also did this.)  So you can go totally hands-free.  Just find a quiet space to work, configure it to your voice and away you go without using your hands at all.  I do find that it's easier to do without others in the room and I have not had great experiences trying the software on the bus/train/coffee shop.  Plus talking to your computer does tend to make others stare at you.  But at home or in an office it's great.  I've also been able to record to a recorder and then input into Dragon, but it's less successful than live voice into Dragon.  I've tried a few recorders and it always suffers from ambient sound noise.  A laptop just seems to work better for me than recorders.

I've used this software for dozens of setups for those with disabilities and injuries.  It's amazing how productive you can be without the use of your hands.  A very, very small investment to save your wrists.  And you really don't have to tweak this version much at all to get it to recognize your voice.  I really love it.  One key is to use an accurate microphone.  I use the Sennheiser ME 3-EW headset EW microphone http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-ME-3-EW-headset-microphone/dp/B002FOFW52/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1410457352&sr=8-16&keywords=dragon+microphone right now and it's great.  But there are cheaper alternatives that appear to be just as good.

Basically Dragon is very similar to Adobe Acrobat Pro in that it's a wonderful application that works.  But it's not one that you really need to upgrade every year.  If you aren't using Dragon now and want hands-free computing then this is what you need.  I will say that I've always found the Premium version to be worth the extra investment, no matter what version I got.  The Home versions are just too limited IMHO.

New User: Get this verison.
Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12+: You can probably wait for at least one more version.
Dragon NaturallySpeaking 1-11: Upgrade when you move to Windows 7 or 8.  You'll find it works better with the newer OS.  Especially if you're using a recorder.",0

"This is my first modification on any type of computer. In fact, I did it incorrectly, and it still worked. What I mean is, you are supposed to download the driver (CDROM or online) and then install the card. Windows XP recognized it immediately and it works as advertised at 480 Mbits/sec. If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on. Power down first, then unplug the device, be it printer, digital camera, external HD, or cordless microphone. It could result in a crash and/or data loss (Thanks to Christine for this word of advice).",0

Yes, it's a hefty price but well worth it.  You can make Holly-wood type movies for a fraction of the price of some of the other editing software out there.",0
"I'm currently running Windows 7 Ultimate on my laptop (and loving it -- see my other reviews for Windows 7 Home Premium or Professional editions), but I want to point out that unless you want to use BitLocker hard drive encryption, or you want to work in multiple languages, there really isn't any reason to buy Windows 7 Ultimate -- instead, Windows 7 Professional is all you need.

With Windows Vista, Microsoft separated functions between Home Premium and Business so that you had to buy the Ultimate version to get all the media-centric capability of Home Premium, and key business-centric functions like Remote Desktop server and Offline Files & Folders of the Business edition of Vista.

With Windows 7, all that has changed now.  Windows 7 Professional has *all* the media-centric capability of Windows 7 Home Premium, PLUS the business functions.  The ONLY two things you get with Windows 7 Ultimate is the ability to encrypt your hard drive and work in multiple languages.  If you're not doing either of those things presently, and if you have no intention of doing either of those things in the future, then save a little money and buy Windows 7 Professional to get everything the Home Premium has plus all the business functions you're probably used to.

That said, you may still choose Windows 7 Ultimate if you want to do an in-place upgrade (where you keep all your installed programs and settings, rather than reinstall everything).  You can't upgrade from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional with an in-place upgrade (I tried; it didn't let me).  So if you've already got Vista Ultimate, and you want to do an in-place upgrade to Windows 7, then you'll still want to buy the Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade for a smooth transition.

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk? You can, but here's how. Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install. During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet. Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7. Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7. After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows. I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully. Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route. Final note: This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer. If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version. As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing."" :-)",0
"I am not going to beat around the bush here.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have ever had the misfortune of working with.  This is coming from someone that has used Windows ME and Vista.  I don't know what Microsoft was thinking in releasing OS or if they were even thinking at all. But apparently they only care about the ""next big thing"", and care nothing about people who actually use their software.  They also apparently don't have a QA department because I find it very hard to believe that any sane person would sign off on an OS with so many usability problems and bugs.  I don't know where to begin but to get started I will just take excerpts from an opinion I wrote about Windows 8 on another website and go from there.

Windows 8 was clearly designed for a touchscreen, but not every one wants touchscreen, and not every windows application is compatible with touch screen. Users should not be forced to buy a computer that has touch screen just so they can use Windows 8. Windows 8 might work well on a tablet or phone, but it sucks as a desktop OS however Microsoft seems hell bent on shoving touch screen down our throats.  If people wanted a tablet or a phone, then guess what?  They would BUY a tablet or a phone.  Why try to force an OS designed for tablets or phones onto a desktop or laptop?

To my surprise Windows 7 ended up being a pretty good OS and I use it at work and many people also like Windows 7. However Microsoft had to go and ASSUME (like they always do) that we all want touch screen now and remove everything that worked so well in previous OS's.  i.e. the start button.  Pressing the windows key on Windows 8 will not bring up the start menu, but instead it will bring you to a poorly designed screen with stupid tiles every where making finding what you want a tedious task.  They hid everything from you and many times you have to search the web to get help to find what you are looking for.

Touch screen is stupid for a desktop or laptop computer. The tiles, metro UI, or whatever you call it is idiotic and makes working in the OS an absolute nightmare. I couldn't care less about stupid teeny bopper Facebook or other social media crap. I just want to do what I need to do on the computer and not have to go through menu after menu of Nickelodeon type tiles just do a simple task. This OS isn't about productivity, its about pretty colors, and Facebook status updates. Microsoft seemed to forget people actually do WORK on their computers.  For example I VPN to my work network to work from home occasionally and I need remote desktop connection to connect to the many servers I use at work.  However because Windows 8 is so poorly designed, instead of just double clicking the mstsc application to open a new window, now double clicking it just brings up the existing connection, meaning I have to again search for the mstsc app, right click it and then click open new connection.  This takes a lot of time especially when I'm working on 3, 4, or 5 servers at the same time.  Even stuff like configuring a printer or getting into the control panel is an exercise in hair pulling frustration.  Switching between windows which what 99.999% of people who actually do WORK on a laptop do, is extremely cumbersome basically eliminating any hope of productivity.  Heck even turning the damn thing off, or logging a user off is made unnecessarily complicated. Who ever designed this OS or thought people would actually like this mess needs to be fired and banned from ever designing an OS again.

Luckily the only computer in my household that had this turd of an operating system was my son's laptop.  But low and behold Windows 8 crashed for the 2nd time and now won't let me back in thanks to the endless ""We are automatically repairing your PC"". loop.  The automatic repair is just as useful as Window's assistant in previous operating systems.  Now I can't get into Windows at all so all the stuff is now gone.  Luckily I had the foresight not to put any important files on this computer so I really don't lose anything.  I'm writing this review on my Windows XP laptop I bought nearly 6 years ago, and other than a few hardware issues, the operating system itself has been pretty solid, which is much more than I can say about Windows 8.  Today I'm going to install Windows XP on my son's laptop and be done with it.  I should have done this as soon as my son got this laptop and I wouldn't be going through this today.

Windows 8 is the reason I will never buy another laptop unless it comes with Windows 7. In addition, I will never even consider purchasing a Windows Tablet or a Windows phone. Words simply can't express how much I hate, loathe, despise, detest, abhor this operating system.  I can't wait to get it off my son's laptop and out of my life for good.",1

"I'm a Photoshop professional- I use Photoshop daily and have for many years. Most of what you can do here you can do in Photoshop, of course, but it's a lot harder to learn and the cost difference is phenomenal-- $40 vs $6-700! So my review will have some bias. That said, CPSPX4U is a delight. I won't run down the individual features as many others have done a great job describing them.

I can imagine a bit of a learning curve for someone who hasn't used any image editing software, but it's worth taking the time to learn. My advice to beginners is to explore. Open a copy of whichever photo you want to manipulate (ALWAYS work on copies- whichever program you're using!) and start trying each section. Within a section, explore the tools and within each tool, explore the variations you can use.

For the intermediate user, someone who has used other photo-editing software, I think you'll enjoy the different approaches you'll find in this application. Let yourself go wild and play. Work using a succession of copies, then toss the ones that don't work out and save the good variations.

For professionals who create digital art - I find using another program - even if you work primarily in Photoshop or Illustrator, is particularly helpful from a creative perspective. Sure, you can pretty much do everything in your main app, but I'm willing to bet you didn't think of many of these ideas- so having them in front of you is wonderful. We ALL get set in our ways -- working in a different application forces us to create with a different tool - and I believe you can't have enough tools at your disposal. I don't use secondary apps for the primary things I do in Photoshop as much as for the filters, layer effects, etc, available in another app. PaintshopProX4 Ultimate has a delightful range of filters and plugins. I find switching between Photoshop and Paintshop Pro (or Corel Paint) offers me the widest range of inspiration within my work. I recommend this app for all levels of users- you simply can't go wrong for the price.",0

"Acronis, rightly, is known in the IT world I occupy as a solid backup and restore player in the business. On servers, I have always relied on Acronis to help me restore everything from the Operating System itself to the application specific data, such as Exchange Server mailbox databases.

I am very pleased to report that Acronis is doing the same thing in the PC market. I did not use the whole-PC recovery, choosing instead to use the Non-stop backup primarily. In this, I found it almost childishly simple to operate. I chose which particular folders I wanted to have a continuous backup of and within minutes, it was running seamlessly. This kind of backup is suggested to be placed onto an external drive, which I have. If the USB drive that I use is not presently connected, non-stop backup does not operate, but will instantly start once you do plug it in.
Unfortunately, within a few weeks of turning it, I mistakenly deleted almost 1GB worth of Word documents, but not only was I able to restore them, I was able to do so for several versions of the documents running back to when I first turned on Non-Stop backup.
I would use the PC backup tools installed on here, but for me, it's easier to re-apply my laptop image and safeguard my data. Interestingly, the re-application of images is exactly how True Image operates as well!

"A LITTLE HISTORY
As a user of Dictate 1.0, I was very interested in the update to the initial offering. Being on sabbatical from my teaching position while I complete my doctoral dissertation, I have been and am in the midst of a sizable research and writing project. I found Dictate 1.0 to be very helpful initially. However, having to stop your train of thought to try and type in an unrecognized word, became cumbersome. Dictate need a ""Spelling Mode"" desperately.

Enter Dictate 1.2. With a great deal of hope and anticipation, I eagerly awaited my review copy of the update. It seemed like it took years for my friendly neighborhood mail carrier (a rarity in these days of ""Postal"" mail carriers) to deliver my little box of happiness. It finally arrived and I have been using it now for a few weeks.

In February, MacSpeech released version 1.3 of Dictate. I am using the new version and have been impressed with some of the useful new features. Enough of this small talk, let's jump in and see just what Andy (Andrew Taylor - President & Founder - Very nice man) and company have cooked up for the Dictate Fans-O-Plenty.
A BRIEF WORD ABOUT FEATURES
Of course you can go to the product page to get a complete list of product features. We won't add undo length here for that. Suffices to say, from my point of view (after all, I am the one pushing the keycaps here) the major features of Dictate are: Natural Speaking Voice Recognition, Unparalleled (on the Mac platform) Accuracy, Spelling Mode, Phrase Training, Document Cacheing, and the Press the Key/Key Combo commands. We will take a closer look at these important, at least to me, features, so read on... If you dare (cue suspenseful music in the background).
USING DICTATE 1.3
Once you have installed the software, plugged in the included Plantronics USB Headset (nice headset BTW), completed the brief voice recognition training session, and saved your profile you are ready to, Dictate. When starting the program you are presented with a profile activation screen.

Now that you have activated your profile, the program loads the status window, available commands window, and a text window.

Simply turn on the mic (click on the stop sign icon or use the keyboard shortcut: Command+F11) and start dictating or issuing commands to your Mac through the many system commands which come standard with the program.  As if by magic, your words begin to appear on the screen. It really is a wonderful technology. You can also dictate directly into your favorite word processor. I am using AppleWorks (No cracks please. Call me old school, it sounds much less pathetic.) and have found Dictate to work seamlessly within this venerable Mac staple.

Let's say for arguments sake, that you say a word that Dictate does not recognize, ""antediluvian."" Here is where Dictate 1.3 has been greatly improved. In version 1.0, you would have to stop, fiddle around with the program so you could type the word with the keyboard, type the word and try and get the dictation mode to resume (not always an easy thing). With 1.3, you simply say, ""Spelling Mode"" the status windows indicates the mode change and you can then spell the word, adding punctuation as needed. Once you have finished spelling the word, say, ""Dictation Mode"" and you are ready to continue with your natural dictation. The process could be a little smoother (more on this later), but all in all, a vast improvement over 1.0.

We move on from the ability to spell out words from within the program to the ability to train the program to recognize unique phrases. Let's use, ""MyMac.com"" as an example. Saying MyMac.com into the program yielded My Mac.com most of the time. Not too bad, but not right. By saying, ""train the words MyMac.com""  I put the program into Phrase Training Mode which activated the Recognition window.

If the correct version is not listed, simply click in the closest version, make any needed changes, push return and done. Once I gave Dictate a crash course in the linguistics of MyMac.com, it proved to be a studious learner. I haven't had a problem with it recognizing the term since. This is a great feature and will prove helpful for the power user who dictates large blocks of text into the program.

One of the updated features of version 1.3, is an improved ability to cache a document into Dictate thereby allowing you to navigate and edit any document. Bringing some test documents into the program worked well and as expected. This will be helpful for users who want to edit and repurpose archived documents. Nice improvement to an already strong feature set.

While not quite as evolutionary as the ability to spell words into Dictate, two of the new features of 1.3 have greatly improved the overall usability of the program. You can now command Dictate to, ""Press the Key"" or ""Press the Key Combo."" I found these features very useful when one has not taken the time to memorized the proper Dictate commands for a given action. Yeah yeah, I know, but sometimes you just have to, ""GET 'ER DONE!""
MAKING A GREAT PROGRAM EVEN BETTER
There are a couple of areas where Dictate could be refined and improved.  While the new Spelling Mode is a great improvement to the program, the implementation is a little cumbersome to use. The switching of modes greatly reduces the flow of naturally speaking your text into the program. If one could quickly spell a word seamlessly into the dictation process, this would help the writers who would like to use this program a great deal.

MacSpeech has noted that one should not attempt to use the mouse or keyboard while Dictate is running. Indeed, this is a no no. The program becomes unstable and dictation is sporadic at best. Once the mic was turned off, editing within the document was possible. I would great if Dictate could allow keyboard and or mouse interaction while it is running.

Switching between programs while Dictate is running can cause some stability issues. Of course, in this multitask world, one must be able to shift gears from time to time. The program needs a little refinement in this area.
MYMAC RATING
All refinements and improvements aside, this is a great program that will allow you to dictate large blocks of standard text (sans highly technical terms, and nonstandard words which must be spelled) naturally and accurately. Realizing that with a few refinements this great program could be even better, I am, with proper diction and elocution, giving MacSpeech Dictate 1.3 an enthusiastic MyMac rating of 4.5 out of 5.",0

"SO glad I found this on Amazon and didn't use Norton's auto renewal (at a much higher price).
Installed fine and working just fine too!
HINT - I bought it at the low price, but waited til my current software was about to expire in a day or two, before INSTALLING IT......so I get the full 365 days use of product before I need to renew again.",0
"I love this server software! Setting it up didn't take too long. The installation took a while but after that, it was smooth sailing. Having a lot of computer-related knowledge in server and internet security, it was easy to get all my network PCs and Macs connected and be able to access documents off the server from any machine.",0
Working great and good price,0

"It's Office.  I use Word and Excel all the time.  Have used powerpoint and Access as well. I've tried other apps, but they always seem to fall short of Office and therefore I've actually purchased two of these!  That Outlook is not included is insignificant to me as I rarely use Outlook.  But I did purchase Outlook sometime ago and if I need to, the older version will probably work fine for me.",0

"Geart deal, quick shipping and it works great. All you do is plug it into your PC and follow the instructions. Well worth the price and the  shippng was fast",0
This is the standard for office suites as far as I an many others are concerned. This is a version that operates from the www. It has all the core applications of Office Professional. It has Publisher and Access as well. It is a wonderful option for a family in that it licens 5 devices. The only drawback is the yearly subscription of around $99.00. It is a very nice alternative for a family.,0
Delivered on time and product was exactly as described. Would buy from this vendor again. Thank You,0

"Just bought a Security WebCam about two weeks ago,  before I got it up and running, I read several reviews about this program saying it was better than the software that came with the Camera...  Low and Behold a few days after reading them reviews and deciding I would like to give this program a try,  Amazon offers it for the GREAT PRICE OF $00000000",0
"Alright. I had paid $79 for iWork '09 because it was having some staying power as the current version, and so on a whim I thought I would go and see what 2008 vintage Macintosh computing would be like, using my iMac 2.8GHz that I reviewed under iMac MB325LL/A. So since the iMac came with a Summer 2008 version of Leopard and iLife '08, I thought I would give iWork '08 a whirl since the iMac was overheating running the '09 versions of iWork and iLife and Leopard 10.5.8, not to mention Snow Leopard or Lion, or especially Mountain Lion.

Well, Pages and Numbers are lacking in features and the presentation of all three of them isn't quite as polished, but one little thing that really bugged me about the newer version of iWork, specifically Keynote '09 (some ""builds"" were only available as building in, while others were only available building out), was not the case on my copy of iWork '08. Other people's copies may be different, but iWork '08 proved that sometimes the grass is greener on the other side, even if it often isn't.

Seeing as how I love Keynote (always been fascinated by presentation programs, in fact I went to great efforts to take Microsoft Office for Mac 4.2.1 off of a Workgroup Server 6150 and put it on our primary family computer of the time, a Performa 6116CD to show you how much I loved presentation software) this was a delightful surprise making iWork '08 worth what I paid for it, which was $20 plus insignificant shipping, and it may find permanent use when I permanently semi-retire the iMac, which isn't totally through with school tasks yet, just taking a school task break to help increase it's longevity as much as possible.

So in the end, for what iWork '09 really let me down on but iWork '08 succeeded on, it's every bit as 5-starred as iWork '09, because I have Microsoft Office:mac 2008 Home and Student and 2 copies of Office 2007 I can rely on for more advanced stuff.

I love iWork, once it got a spreadsheet app, which means iWork '08 or later. iWork before Numbers had too gaping a hole in my opinion.",0
Works great,0
"Over the past two weeks, I have been testing the VMware Fusion 2 product.  Wow, I have to admit that I am seriously impressed with this software package.  It truly makes using Windows a seamless experience that is truly enjoyable!  Here is what's so great about Fusion 2:

1) It makes installing Windows a fun and ""fearless"" experience.

In the past, I have always used Apple's Bootcamp (a competing product) to run Windows on my Macbook Pro (2.4 GHz with 4 GB of RAM).  Only problem is that Apple's Bootcamp program can be a ""little confusing"" to use -- and when I first went to install Windows on my new Mac, I apparently didn't read the technical installation manually as carefully as I should of, and accidentally wound up wiping out my machine to the point that it wouldn't start.  Oh oh...  Not good!  ;-)  I eventually got it back up and running, with Windows installed on it, but it really wasn't the most user-friendly way of installing Windows on my Mac!

However, with the introduction of VMware's Fusion 2, the process of installing Windows just became a real snap!  When I first started the program, it asked me if I would like to install Windows on my computer.  I said yes and it prompted me to insert my Windows installation disc into the drive.  The moment that I did this, it took control over the installation and after a bit, I have Windows freshly installed on my computer!  (Also, for those of you who want to use your Bootcamp partition, they give you the option of simply using it, or even migrating it directly to your Mac, as a virtual drive -- which helps to free up tons of space on your drive!)  It works seamlessly...

2) Run both Windows and Mac applications together at once!

This is one seriously cool feature of VMware Fusion 2.  Since Windows is running virtually on your machine, it means that you can unify both your Microsoft Office applications and your Mac programs together as one powerful software suite.  Fusion 2 comes with a feature called ""Unify"" that allows me to start up my Mac contacts and Microsoft Excel at the same time.  I can exchange information between these programs simply by using ""copy and paste""!  Also, unlike Apple's Bootcamp software, I don't have to reboot my system every time that I want to use a program from the other OS.  This makes both me and my Mac more productive!

3) Run your favorite PC games on the Mac!

If you're like me, you probably enjoy a little break here and then -- and that means playing a computer game, once in a while.  ;-)  Best of all, with Fusion 2, you can enjoy a wide selection of PC games on your Mac, as if they were designed for it.

4) Excellent Hardware Support

Out of all of the virtualization that I have played with over the years, Fusion 2 (by far) is years ahead of the competition.  They have written plug-ins for your operating systems that enable full hardware support, such as iSight cameras, USB drives and the ability to print over the network.  These are very welcomed features in my mind that place this software package above the competition.  This helps to make running Windows (and Linux) a vastly superior option.

THE DISADVANTAGES:
Honestly, it's kind of hard to find very many with this program, as it seems that the developers took the time needed to develop a well-tested application.  However, I did find a few, minor issues that you will want to be aware of:

- Product Deactivation for Bootcamp users

If you already have Windows installed and running on your computer, Fusion 2 gives you the ability to run it virtually.  When I ran Windows XP virtually for the first time, Windows immediately deactivated both the operating system and my copy of Microsoft Office.  Also, Adobe Creative Suite CS2 immediately deactivated too, which was not good.  To fix this, I had to reactivate my products, which means that you may have to spend some time on the phone waiting for customer service to give you permission to re-use your software again.

- There seems to be an issue with Time Machine.  I have a USB hard drive connected to my Macbook Pro and while it's connected, it actually prevents Windows XP from being able to successfully boot.  To fix this problem, simply disconnect the drive (during the booting process) and everything will work fine!

- Out of two weeks of heavy usage, I experienced only one minor crash.  VMware Fusion 2 handled it beautifully and no data was lost.

IN SUMMARY:
This is one AWESOME product that I highly recommend.  Don't waste your time with Apple's Bootcamp -- make the switch of being able to truly enjoy your mac the way you want.  Yes, nowadays, who says you can't have it all...  ;-)",0
Great software to help you discover the world of new design possibilities. It can be used for both home and school. This is adaptable for both the casual user and the more advanced.,0
This is a great addition to my software library. This helps me to condense files and free up space.  I am not very computer savvy but the product fulfilled my needs.,0
"I got this OS for a new computer that I put together, works great.

"This is a simple, step by step program that allows to build a basic last will and testament.  When I mean basic, it allows to cover the steps that you need to think through, in GENERAL, with regard to basic statements, basic building steps, correct wording and bequests.  And for most people, this is sufficient.  The interface is super easy to navigate, and it produces a clean basic will.  The advance directives, power of attorney documents are also easy to navigate, complete and print.

What this doesn't have (that I could find) was a way to recognize living members of your immediate family - to stave off court challenges from relatives that felt that they had been slighted; because that kind of thing can and does happen.

I also liked that there is also a proviso for your electronic accounts and files.  Most people think of ""things"" or ""money amounts"" when it comes to bequests, but seldom do we think of who gets our electronic files, digital pictures and the like.  This also includes a schedule of electronic subscriptions, apps, emails, credit accounts, online banking, etc. and so on.

However, this program is NOT an easy bypass for wills that are overtly complicated and involve legal maneuvering outside of basic bequests.  So if your estate planning does involve advance tax planning for heirs, etc. you will need to work with a licensed, qualified probate attorney.",0
This internet security was easy to install and easy to use. I haven't had any security issues since installing it so I would say I'm well protected. I would recommend it to others for their computers.,0
I installed this on 3 of the computers/laptops we have in the house.  It worked seamlessly with the different versions of Windows we were running and kept our computers safe!,0
Great piece of software that does everything I need on the computer. Thought I would post a review for this as I've finally upgraded to the newer version. Seamless operations and never crashes or has calculation error.,0
awesome fast,0
"This is a fantastic product! I put off using it for a while after it came. It's kind of a grim thing to think about, but we are all mortal, and it's very important to make sure this kind of business is taken care of. I thought it would be complicated and that I would need a lot of information to get started. Not so!
When I opened the box, I found not only the CD with the software (Windows XP/Vista/7/8,), but also the handy, easy-to-understand handbook from NoLo, The Legal Answer Book for Families with basic advice from lawyers relating to marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, adoption, children, and elder care.
This information will be very useful for people with large families and complex issues related to their estates. Our current situation is very simple, so I did not need it to set up a will, but I am glad to have it as a reference.
NoLo's self-help legal guides have worked for my husband and me before. We handled his mother's estate, which turned out to be more complex than we had expected, using one of their books, and everything went well.
To use the software, simply load it into your computer, register it, and then answer some very simple interview questions. Then, hit print, and all the documents you need for your state and county will print out, ready to be witnessed and signed. That's it. You can also print out record pages to collect and keep track of your assets. We are going to do that when we prepare our taxes in January.
As a bonus, you get a free one year subscription to NoLo's Living Trust service online.
We have been worried about this particular task for a long time. It seemed so complicated. It was a relief to see how easy it was. A little time now (a few minutes) can save many people a lot of money and grief later. I recommend it!",0

"Adobe approved ""Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3, Learn by Video"" is the absolutely best method of learning Lightroom 3 that I've found. It's one on one training presented by Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland. The program truly has just about everything to get you up and running full hilt. You'll progress from the very beginning of setting Lightroom up to importing photos, developing them, exporting them and everything in between. It does not contain everything that anyone would want in an educational program - that would be a practical impossibility. However, this program contains 10 hours of video training: you hear how a procedure occurs and you see how it's done, along with advice and opinion. There's even a testing procedure included and reference booklet. You can also copy selected video tutorials. I've had and have been using Adobe Lightroom for a couple years and recently upgraded to Lightroom 3. I've books written about Lightroom 3 by well known authors but I found reading about it was just a little too tedious and finally decided to find out how to make it work for me. This program works, it did for me and frankly I believe it's the best program available.",0
perfect device. the only thing that would Make this better? people that actually wait for it to be released and test it themselves before Reviewing it.,0
I have used Turbo Tax for the last five years and I have had no problems. The Amazon gift card for up to 10% of your return is a great deal.,0
"Ive been using TurboTax since it was first published. Some years I find fault with the program but most of the time it just works. My major complaint is the self-advertising for an endless array of other paid offerings, but I seem to be not even noticing them anymore.

 Since Intuit makes only incremental changes and my tax situation is not complex, it seems to take me a few minutes less each year to complete my taxes because I know the parts of the program I need to use.

 A lot of people have complained of price increases for the program and being forced to buy different, more expensive versions. I find no reason to complain.

 TurboTax has a slight learning curve for new users, but if you follow their guided input and are willing to read the directions (both Intuits and the IRS), everything gets done.

 So TurboTax 2014 looks and feels a lot like TurboTax 2013 and 2012, 2011 and years before that.

 And thats a compliment. I use TurboTax every year because it works. Its that simple.

"Before I begin, let me say that I have absolutely no drawing or artistic skills.  I can barely make a Thanksgiving turkey by tracing my hand and coloring it turkey-like with some crayons.  So, it was with great surprise that I was able to create an animation of any kind using this software.

To start an animation, you begin with a canvas, where you can either use a predefined character, or draw one of your own with a large pallet of drawing tools.  The drawing tools are easy to figure out and work pretty well.

When you're ready to animate your drawing, you can select key areas of the drawing and animate them using the Bones tool.  There are other animation tools as well, but this one is easy to use and is where I spent most of my time.  Once you get a repetitive animation going, like walking for instance, you can use switch layers to easily stretch that pattern out for as long as you'd like, making the building of animations easier.

Another nice thing about Anime Studio Debut is that you can import existing MOV or AVI files and plug your animations into home movies, for instance.  You can then export back to MOV, AVI, or FLV formats.  Though I didn't do it, I think you can also upload directly to YouTube if you want to.

Overall, I found the program to be fairly easy to use and if I can create a decent looking animation with it, anybody can.",0
"I began my college career as in illustration major. I was able to enter a fairly prestigious program as a result of my portfolio (and truly talented high school teachers who invested a great deal in their students). I left the program after two years ... I couldn't conform to the idea of turning-in sloppy-but-on-time work, especially as a photo-realist. Now, I am a professor of English (film-studies is my specialty). Still, I have never stopped drawing and I have always remained in the visual arts. Recently, one of my film-studies students was telling me that actual drawing is archaic. She wasn't taught pen-and-ink, has never used a tortillon, and did not even know about light-tables. She explained that EVERYTHING now happens on her Mac. What a genuine shock. After significant consideration about how this impacts the art-world (and a bit of mourning for my now obsolete talents), I picked up this software.

I provided this introduction so that you know I am entirely new to this form of art ... but not (at all) to art itself. Therefore, basically, I am speaking to those slightly older folks (maybe somewhere in their thirties) who have yet to make this leap.

As a whole, Painter is surprisingly intuitive. Now, since I was provided a short amount of time to learn this program (before this review had to be posted), I remained in the areas in which I was trained. While there was a considerable learning-curve, I was able to produce a few nice pieces (after a several scrapped ones). As I continue to play and expand into areas outside my comfort-zone, I will update this review. Nonetheless, I can also say that it is exciting to experiment with the options provided ... to tinker with a drawing and then ""reset"" it when I don't like the effects, well that's pretty invaluable. (I do remember those days of recreating a piece because my ""bright idea"" of adding spot color or stippling instead of cross-hatching turned out to be sadly incorrect).

The investment here is steep. But, for many of you, it will be well worth it. My advice is to find someone in your field who already has this, take it for a test-drive, and then assess if it is better than what you are currently using. Moreover, if you are a parent considering this for your high-school student, this is a fantastic program ... in fact, it really doesn't get much better.",0
"Over the years, I have used any number of photo editing and graphics programs, ranging from Adobe PhotoShop to CorelDraw to PaintShop Pro.  However, I've never used anything quite like Painter Essentials 5.

This program is designed to help you convert your photographs into art.  It has a number of tools that will let you paint using your photographs as a jumping off point.  It also has filters and algorithms that will automatically convert your photographs into pre-selected styles (e.g., watercolor).  The program gives you controls of numerous parameters and is quite powerful for the price.

I have toyed around with it using a mouse and also a Bamboo pad and pen.  Both work well.  You don't have to be a whiz to get in and start fooling around.  However, if you want to do anything serious with this program, prepare to spend some time learning its process.  The online help isn't bad, but to get the most out of this you'll have to spend some time with it.

It installed and ran like a breeze on an Intel i7-3770K machine I built a few years ago, running Windows 8.1 with 16gb of RAM and a decent AMD video card.  The controls were smooth and responsive.

If you have a yen to make painterly scenes or portraits from your photographs, this is a powerful program that will let you do it.  Just be ready to invest time learning how to get the most out of it.",0

Today, I tried Photo Director 6 on an iMac. I'd say the whole thing went pretty well.

It is very easy to install. Just click through the setup, and it's easy to find in Launchpad. It will prompt you at the bottom of the screen to import your pictures the first time the program opens. Takes a while to upload (mine didn't finish the first time--meaning, I got really annoyed with the program and iPhoto and closed it before it had finished uploading), but you can work on pictures while it's uploading.

So I decided to look at/edit photos from a trip to San Francisco, Carmel, and London. You can see the photos and narratives in my video.  I did some object removal, photo clean-up, color alterations, background removal, exposure setting changes, cropping, and more.

About the Fisherman's Wharf picture, where I removed the black triangle in the corner and the power cord: This was so easy to do! There are automatic tools for literally all of this. It even recreated the letters across the Fisherman's Wharf sign. Impressive!

Adjusting the RGB curve is simple.

Adding noise is easy, but looks more extreme in the program. The photos don't show the high amounts of ""noise"" that I added as much as I thought they would.

The background removal tool doesn't work too well if your background is blurry.  But in my example, it worked well (and it was very simple to use).  In my example, I added a new background to make it look like he was in a more natural environment.

My first complaint: it is so hard to find photos.  I edited the Fisherman's Wharf photo twice because I tried to move it from iPhoto to my Desktop so that I could share it. Moving it caused Photo Director to lose it. I could not find the edited version in either iPhoto or my Desktop, or, for that matter, Photo Director. It was just gone. So I had to edit it again. Now I can't find the 1st butterfly photo with the background removed.

The London photo was edited using the ""People Beautifier"" tool.  I only used a few of the features, but it is very simple and the results can be drastic.  The close-up screenshots show how  much better the picture looks with the skin tone adjusted and the environment brightened up.

So, the bottom line:
- Export your photos as soon as you're done editing them, or else good luck finding them again.
- This program has great features to automatically edit photos, but there are no automatic adjustments (e.g., contrast, tone, curves)
- This is a great, cheaper alternative to Photoshop.
- It works with a Mac. (Hurray!)
- If you are familiar with Photoshop, you will have no problem with this program.
- If you have never edited a photo in your life, this program is much more simplistic than Photoshop (and other major photo editing programs), but can do a lot of the same things.

This program is not perfect, but I no longer feel the need to go buy myself a copy of Photoshop.",0
"This is the 3rd time in 5 years of trying out Norton Internet Security for me. Every year prior just wanted to make me scream. I always had a software bug during the installation process, even though my computer is new. After several hours of trying to get 2007 to install, it finally did, but with frequent problems during the usage of it.

But I broke down, after swearing never to use Norton again, and purchased the 2009 version. Wow, what a change to the better! This software has a process during the initial installation download that removes any prior Norton software links in the registry and cleans it up, for the download of the 2009 version. I had to do a manual shutdown, due to this process sticking during the scanning process for an excess of 25 minutes. But when it rebooted, it promptly completed the process and advised that all prior Norton remnants were removed.

As of 1 week of usage, I have no bootup problems, no excessive CPU usage at any time and the internet usage works great (I changed to the advanced firewall settings).

I have been using the Kaspersky Internet Security 2009 Suite, but after using Norton here, Kaspersky does use a higher amount of CPU usage and the web surfing is slower.

I do notice though, that the full AV scan seems about as long as Kaspersky AV scan in time wise.  But that I found is the only minor low point, which I found is no biggie.

Norton, if it stays like this version, will have a return customer back!",0

For example, Ive set it up to be completely uninstructive unless I actually have a virus.  The default settings are kind of annoying, but you can easily disable unwanted features.

"It has been said that the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is caused from a perceived disconnection from the Divine--either within oneself or in the universe at large.

We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.

Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.

In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.

Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:

*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video

*More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""

*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh

*Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors

*""Light Stone"" energy translator

*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences

*Original Soul Flight music CD

*Companion Guide and User's Manual

The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.

The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

"I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.  Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses ""screen real-estate"" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.
However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.
And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.  The backup feature is excellent as well!!
My hats off to Microsoft for another great product!!",0
"My kids are taking mandarin at the Charter Scholl they attend.  I thought this would be a good addendum to help them with the Class.  I have done the Danish and German Rosetta Stones in the past.  I did get a lot out of the German one but I had taken a German class in college.  The Danish one not so well as my pronounciation of Scandanavian vowels is lacking.  Fortunately the Danes speak American English.

The Mandarin course is a bit different in that it teaches Chinese Letters too though you can decide to do the entire course using only the Roman alphabet.  I found the software can be as easy or as Challenging as you wish.

The Course is presented in three sections.  A basic, intermediate, and more advanced sections.  You create a profile for yourself and based on your age and gender the software will compensate for you on its voice recognition software.

The best thing about the course is the voice recognition.  You say the words and the system tell you if you are correct.  I can't pronounce English very well so I'm not quite sure how accurate it is.

The Basic course is pretty simple.  It teaches you touristy things like eating, walking, running, cooking, and the differences in gender.  I like rosetta stone because it emmerses you in the language.  It doesn't try to translate.  You infer from the pictures what you are saying.

The courses get harder and harder as you go along.  I found I tend to forget what I learned in the class if I try to remember but pick it up again immediately when confronted with it in real life.

I would reccomend it highly for someone just looking for a simple tool to introduce them to the Chinese alphabet and Mandarin.  I thought it and the other courses I got to be well worth it.",0

"This is an excellent alternative to Microsoft Office at 50% less the price.  WordPerfect Office X7 opens all the Microsoft file types (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) and OpenOffice file types (Writer, Spreadsheet, Impress).  I have used OpenOffice for the last 3 years, leaving Microsoft Office after they started forcing user to upgrade from older versions.  For the last month I've been using WordPerfect Office.  It was an easy switch and I am liking WP far more than OO.

MORE FEATURES

OpenOffice worked well for me for basic writing, however it did not give me enough features, graphics, templates, etc.  The ""wow factor"" from my papers, graphs and slideshows was clearly missing.  WordPerfect Office gives me the ""wow factor"" that I was missing.

BEST LAYOUT

I love the clean modern layout of WordPress.  OpenOffice is clearly outdated and very basic.  OpenOffice looks like Microsoft Word 97!  The new Microsoft Office layout is horrible.  Microsoft went with large icons and mixed up their tried-and-true menu structure - a big mistake in my opinion.  Of all 3, WordPerfect is the clear winner in layout.

BETTER VALUE

For under $100 you get a lifetime of use of this software.  Microsoft Office charges you $100 per year!  Based on Corel's history, I doubt they will ever turn off my software - unlike Microsoft.

OpenOffice is of course free to use.  I have used it for years and it is great software.  If you don't need the features of a full office software suite, then go for OpenOffice.  At $0 it's the best deal.  But if you are wanting more and considering Microsoft Office or WordPerfect, WordPerfect is the better value.

"I gave this to a friend with a Mac to try out. He wanted to run some Windows programs on his system and agreed to give this software a go. The results were what you'd hope for: the software successfully emulated a Windows PC and allowed us to access both Windows and Mac software simultaneously. I was skeptical at first that the program would operate as claimed, but was quickly convinced. The makers of the software claim that ""Windows is better on the Mac"" -- and based on this program, they might just be right.",0
"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",0
"I bought Microsoft Office 2007 Professional Academic version because I was (and still am) a struggling (with illnesses mostly) college student, and then I took a chance on the Office 2007 Ultimate Steal Microsoft was running. But I realized I needed more than just 2 PCs to read .docx, .pptx, and .xlsx files on, and this proved to be just the ticket. I could evaluate the new versions of the three most commonly used (for me at least) Office programs on 3 computers.

I have it installed on one nearly brand new PC as of right now; but I will eventually install it onto the rest of the eligible PCs if not indeed buy new systems just for this version of Office. I like what I see from Office 2010. It matches the interface of the Windows Live applications, WordPad, and Paint; which the color scheme chosen for 2007 prevented it from doing. I hope to eventually upgtade my everyday school laptop to one with a new-fangled processor, and the 3-install disc will come in very handy.

I got the last copy of this software available at my local Wal-Mart, and it has proven that you don't have to have the highest-end Office suite to be able to get productive work done, whether for school assignmnents or personal use.

I know Office 2003 is better, but my school has long since switched to 2007 and now 2010, so I had to get with it, and not keep using something so outdated on PCs that I hope to earn my college degree with.

In summation, I am keeping Office 2007 Professional and Ultimate around for tasks requiring off-the-wall Office applications, but my daily driver wersion of Office will become 2010, despite the fact I feel like it's 2007 with a new coat of paint.",0

"My brother is a home remodeler, and worked as a Real Estate broker for well over 30 years. During that time he became someone who was deeply involved in design decisions that were made before new construction started. Finally becoming a remodeler himself. It is fascinating to see his depth of knowledge transform itself on the screen. He has been using an older version of the top Chief Architect program, version 9.5 with a hefty price tag. With this newer version, albeit a junior version of their flagship product, shows many advances over the old full version of the program. He didn't need to draw up blueprints because when it got to the point that additions were being built, he would hire a licensed architect to take his plans and finalize them for approval.
When I showed him this program, in no time at all he was creating multi-room dwellings completely furnished etc. He wants to use it for his remodeling business. Bringing a finished photograph of the remodeling changes was an excellent customer exciter. He had that feature in the old program but it also included ""ray trace"" which was a photo enhancer to make photographs appear more lifelike. He was using Chief Architect 9.5 before. In addition this designer 10 does not have the same sophisticated CAD program. For example if you wanted to show the detail in the foundation, for example the size of the individual block, and components. Even with all that in mind, he loves the program for his day to day business.
Personally I found the tutorial videos very informative, and enabled me to start creating rooms, laying out the outer walls. There are a lot of automatic functions that make it easier for the novice. I am also very excited about the features included in the program including landscaping and decks. What blew my mind was the option of planting a wide array of bushes, and then with a click or two you could determine what they would look like when they were more mature. What a great way to make smart landscaping choices. The amount of detail that the landscaping function includes with all of the different plant species.
This is a great program. Download the trial version and check it out. Highly recommended.",0
"I'm using Win7Pro x64.  When it works, it works.  However, incompatibility issues can make this version of Windows a nightmare if you have legacy USB and audio gear from previous editions -- including Vista.

Unlike previous editions, what I'm seeing with Win7 x64 is a very slow adoption rate by OEM manufacturers. In the past, they were all in a hurry to jump on the bandwagon.  I guess this time, everyone it tired of the game and holding off for as long as possible before supporting this new version of Windows.  Frankly, it looks like the same nightmare Vista users endured.

I wish I had held off this version of Windows until 2011. If what you have works, don't break it with an upgrade until you can go to the store and Win 7 support on most all the gadget boxes.",1

"For those who don't know, WinZip is a file archiver, a way of compressing files for Windows and other operating systems. It has been around since the early 1990s as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) front end for PKZIP, the data compression utility that had been authored by the late Phil Katz. I note this as two people asked me about ZIP files in the last couple months. So much for the brief history lesson.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is the latest version of WinZip, and is a full-featured product, with a lot of good functionality. It does an excellent job opening and extracting ZIP, Zipx, 7Z, LHA/LZH, RAR, BZ2 and about all of the other major compression file formats of which you can think. It makes fast work of converting Microsoft Word docs (and other Office files) to PDF format, and it's easy to create them as read-only PDF if you want to avoid file alteration by other parties.

This version offers more that the older&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-17-Standard/dp/B009RG41HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 17 Standard</a>&nbsp;and other variations in that it makes it easier to protect your privacy and share files in email messages, in social media, and on the cloud. It has been redesigned to support new add-ons, and cloud navigation makes it simpler to protect, manage and share your files online. An updated Zip engine makes even smaller ZIP and Zipx files.

Now you can display photos within ZIP files without extracting them by using WinZip's internal image viewer, and you can use the 'Photos' button to rapidly transfer photos from supported cameras and iPhones, then rotate and compress them into picture shows for sharing. Among the new features, you can use direct access to cloud services. These include Google Drive, SkyDrive (now Cloud Drive), and Dropbox, which I've tried successfully. You can also access other cloud services such as  Box, CloudMe and SugarSync, though I have not tried these. You can also send links to your cloud files via instant messaging, email and social media with the Cloud Links feature.

If you have a large number of digital images on your hard drive, it will reduce your .JPG files by about 20 to 25% with no loss of photo quality or data integrity. Photographers with a large number of images should note that WinZip may (or may not) cause some issues with image management/viewing applications such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Nikon ViewNX 2, so run some tests before you try to compress all of your images. I have not tried compressing RAW images, as keeping them intact is a personal thing.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is available here on CD-ROM or as a PC download for Windows 7, Vista and Windows 8.x.

Users of the WinZip 17 versions may or may not wish to go for this new version; it's a personal choice depending on what features you want. Both versions do their job well, have a good interface, and are extremely handy for taking advantage of cloud storage.

"This Stopmotion Studio is just what I needed for both me and my son to have fun making stop motion videos and overall experimenting with creative film making.

Unfortunately, I only have a portable web came to use with the Stopmotion Studio software. I hope soon to get something better, but even now it works for use to experiment with software.

The interface has a lot to it, but  you quickly learn your way around it. It sure didn't take long for my 10 year old to figure it out. I left him alone with Stopmotion Studio for 30 minutes. When I came back, I found him adding special effects to a still that I didn't even know we could do! Further looking, he took 119 shots and created a 12-15 second Godzilla theme that I thought was fantastic for his first time doing this. I was flabbergasted and absolutely proud of my son for his creativity and initiative.

I really like this software. It's relatively easy to use and has a lot of good features to get your creative juices flowing. I particularly like the onion skin to help me ghost a previously taken image onto my work area so I use it as a guide for my next pose.

"This is definitely not your mother's WordPerfect.  WordPerfect is one of the first word documents software available.  However, you will notice that this is similar to Microsoft Word.  Corel has made many software products, and they have a sustained reputation with software users.

I have installed this on Windows 8.1.  There was an easy setup with two discs.  I started using a table and although creating the table was easy, I was not able to click on a www link and have it automatically take me to the site.  But,  I managed to work with it anyway.

I love the step by step tutorials in the HELP REFERENCE CENTER.  This is vital with any software program.  And for further information you can log into Wordperfect.com and Corel.  You can log into more tutorials if needed.

Publishing to PDF is an important feature.  Anymore, these days, we are always sending files and preserving the file in PDF is critical for the receiver or for another device.  This program has a usable friendly feature for using and creating PDFs.  The capabilities are limited, but user friendly for those who do not need excessive PDF features.

Now,  mail merge can be challenging, if you have old Word programs, however, with this WordPerfect, the steps are very easy.  Macros...  another improvement from Older Word programs.

Also, other great features with WordPerfect are the e-book publishing software....so many people can certainly use this, as this is the era of self-publishing.  The disc burning software is a wonderful feature.

As I mentioned, if you have used only outdated WordPerfect programs,  you will be quite impressed with the Word Perfect Office x7 Software Program....  This is amazing with so many capabilities..  Rizzo",0
"Norton's latest antivirus program does the job without bogging your system down with features.

The box is just a download code so that novices may be confused.  You go to the Norton website, create an account, and add the code.  Then you download your program.  It works on either Mac or PC

The install took less than a minute after the download to install, and I didn't need to reboot. This software is a basic antivirus without advanced firewall features.  I like this because full firewalls often get in the way.

This box is only one license, which is a steep price compared to competitors.  They offer free tech support, but I've always had bad experiences with their tech support. Language barriers are extreme with Norton.  The ""no-virus"" guarantee requires auto-renewal of the program.  The guarantee means you get a refund if you get a virus, not necessarily the virus removed.",0

"Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed.  After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.

Things glo has improved upon:

++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are ""lenses"" that ""distribute content over a zoomable interface,"" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.

++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.

++  The user can check out the ""contributors and sources"" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.

++  There is a ""Quick Install"" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.

++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.

++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.

The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this ""revolutionary new Bible"" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.

GLO features:

++  450+ Virtual Tours
  These are 360-degree tours of ""modern-day and re-created"" ancient biblical locations.""

++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos
  You'll be able to enjoy the ""In His Shoes"" HD interactive documentary.

++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos
  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.

++  7,500+ Articles
  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan

Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.

++  650+ Works of Art

++  Integration with the best web content

++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program

++  Concise, compact organization through five ""lenses""

++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study

LENSES:

BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.

TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation

MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and ""reading plans.""

MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.

ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger ""picture"" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.

TOPICAL:  Here you can ""quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.""

This is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.",0
"This antenna is great.  I set it up at my house and it provides a good signal all the way to my guest house, which is 250ft away at least and with 5 walls between the computer and the router.

If your router has a removable antenna and you need increased range buy this antenna, if you are worried it won't work buy it at Fry's and try it for a week, you won't be disappointed.",0
"A lot of features for not a lot of price, it does have a bit of a learning curve but they provide a lot of lessons and guidance on how to use each feature. If you have any background with video editing, this offers an easy step into some useful task, though not entirely advanced compared to other programs. I'd heartily suggest it for people who aren't willing or interested to jump in to the more professional programs, or are interested but they're budget isn't--but who want to have more creative possibilities than what a basic program like Windows Movie Maker or lower end/price programs. This is also a really good stepping stool for those higher end products. Get to know basics and exploration on this, then if and when you find you come to the end of what it offers, move on. The expensive programs really are overkill for the great majority of people (and I say this as someone who has the Adobe suite and realize that even as an educator I'm paying more than what I reasonably need to use).

"I've used the full version of Corel Painter for years and it's one of my favorite packages for digital art, especially when using a Wacom Tablet. The power of the full version is a bit too much for many people, but Painter Essentials is accurately named: it captures the essential piece of Painter and allows an artist that's new to digital art or that doesn't want to learn a bunch of menus to create something beautiful.

The user interface is very intuitive and has quite a few features from the full version, but with a greatly simplified interface. The selection of brushes isn't quite as rich as with the full version, but it's very powerful at its price point.

One thing many may like are the tools for creating art from a photograph. The workflow is very easy and lets you have some fun with your photos. The mirror image tool is fun, but the most popular tool for my kids is the auto paint mode. You import a photograph, choose a style, and the program takes over. It's kind of interesting to watch, but it's not very fast. Once the auto paint has finished, you can edit the results.

Overall, I think this is a nice tool for someone who's getting into digital art, but I recommend using a tablet instead of a mouse since a digitizing pen lets you move much more naturally.",0

"As a Vista-fugue, the main reasons for even bothering with a `Bootcamp' Windows installation were Microsoft ""Office"" and Intuit's ""Quicken/Turbotax"", both richer-featured in their PC than in their Mac releases.  Disappointingly, iWork '08 'Pages' performed better as an image-based page layout package for the multimedia center crowd, proving woefully underpowered in a professional business office ... crippled by the tediously awkward conversion hassle from  *.doc to  *.pages documents.

No more!  With iWork '09, Apple has virtually erased any remaining barrier to business office `switchers' still on the fence.  I have explored and tested Pages '09 since its online release as a downloadable fully functional 30-day trial demo.  I was so impressed with the new Pages (as against the flashy eye candy of the '08 version) that I ordered the full boxed version.  [The trial software is well worth a test run to see if iWork meets your needs.)  The new Pages now easily exports a document in doc, txt or pdf format, and does a remarkably lifelike transformation of even highly complex Word documents, tables, lists, or legal briefs with a mere double-click or drag-and drop.

Rather than spreading myself too thin, I limit this review to `Pages', leaving commentary on `Numbers' to spreadsheet buffs ... `Numbers' capabilities, in the past, were no match for the depth of MS-Excel.  If  `Numbers`  performs as well as  `Pages'  in this  iWork  overhaul, then the product will be the best eighty bucks gift for your Mac.  `Keynote', an image-with-outline presenter's tool, probably will prove at least the equal of MS-PowerPoint considering the Mac's flair for spectacular graphics.

`Pages' well may be the impressive turnaround software that elevates the Mac from multimedia center toy to serious professional business status.  Highly recommended for Vista-weary PC users and Mac loyalists looking for a solid business suite.  The detailed crystal-clear manuals and crisp `Help' replies are welcome value-added resources.",0

"This remains an outstanding trip planning and GPS program.  Unfortunately, some of the map details are still not as good as were found in the 2004 version of this program. I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simplifying which only serves to confuse.

Despite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better more affordable solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook computer.  Even if you have an ""all in one"" solution such as the Garmin Nuvi Streets and Trips can help you plan your trip and routs.  I have both and they compliment one another very well.

A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.

I heartily recommend this product!  The updated mapping details and new points of interest are also useful.",0

"I started my computer ""career"" on Apple II computers with big floppy drivers, green screen monitors, and a whopping 48kb of RAM! Those were the days. Ever since, we have been striving for the perfect computing experience where it is about the creative work or otherwise being done, not the work being done to keep the computer happy.

Soon after the Apple II days, I spent time on a Sperry Univac before finally settling into MS-DOS on an IBM and then an HP; this lead to Windows 3.1, 95, 98, NT, (not) ME, 2000, XP, and the oh-so-not-ready for primetime Vista. Along the way, I operated a Graphics Lab that was half Windows NT workstations and half Apple Mac OS 9 computers. Those were not the days...I spent too much time getting them to talk to each other, to see the file server, and just keeping them running efficiently.

Then there were Mac OS X and Mac Pro workstations! My creative work environment has been reinvented. But, there is always a legacy, and mine is Windows software without a Mac version or without a migration option - some things just can't get there from here...until now.

Parallels Desktop allows for multiple virtual Windows machines to be created in Mac OS X; and, not just Windows, but Linux, OS/2 (people still use that??), FreeBSD, Sun Solaris, and plain old MS-DOS (talk about some serious legacy issues if you need this). I have no experience with the other OSs listed, but as far as Windows goes, it is amazing! Each virtual machine is a self contained computer to the operating system using it, and Parallels Desktop handles all of the communications with the hardware and the Mac file system and drag and drop capabilities between the two operating systems.

Parallels Desktop creates disk image for each virtual machine that grows in size as the VM requires; this disk image holds all of the files - system, programs, and data - that is installed on the VM. It also offers an option to have your Mac documents folder and your desktop serve as the documents folder and desktop on your VM, streamlining the storage of all of your valuable files in one place.

The single greatest accomplishment of this software is the Coherence Mode. This mode eliminates the window housing the VM and moves the Windows Task Bar and Start Menu down to the bottom of your Mac desktop. Any software or folder window you open from the Windows VM opens in its own window on the Mac and looks like a Windows window instead of a Mac window - you will always know where and what you are working on.
Parallels Desktop also includes some nifty tools as well. The Snapshot feature allows you create a backup snapshot of your VM at anytime and revert back to it if necessary. But, the best tool, is Parallels Explorer, which allows you to view and work with the file system of the VM when it is not running.

If I had one criticism, it would be how CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs are handled between the two - essentially, you have to connect to the CD/DVD drive for the Windows VM to see it, and if you are installing a multi-disk software package, you have to continually connect and disconnect to the drive...it is very laborious. I would like to see a more fluid and automatic process in the future.

Overall, this is amazing software that blurs the line between Mac and Windows and allows for the best of both worlds. My Windows XP install runs better in the Parallels Desktop virtual machine than it did on my high-end laptop!",0

"It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support -- Limited PDF support in Home/Student Edition

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  The more expensive version of WordPerfect handles PDF files and will import text and graphic based PDF files and will perform optical character recognition on the PDF file.  As the comment below shows, Corel indicates this version does not open PDF files, although it will publish to PDF.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Although it is not perfect, WordPerfect converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is extremely powerful.  It is just that like most M/S software, it does too much and takes the control away from the user.  It is also unfamiliar to me because the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  Accordingly, I prefer to use WordPerfect and save the output as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph. If you want to change one paragraph, you can do it with a single keystroke (the WordPerfect 6 keystrokes are F4 for left indent or Shift-F4 for double indent).

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] codes and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. For example, once I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!

One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.

As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

"I thought it would be hard to improve upon the 2015 version of Painter but there are tons of additions/improvements, including the ability to import Adobe Photoshop .abr brush files, retaining such things as dab shape, texture, dynamics, but note that other attributes which are not supported will require some customization of brushes after import...at least an encouraging improvement that will probably be tweaked and further improved in future versions.  Most important to me is improved performance and stability with brushes up to three times faster, not to mention tons of new brushes.  You can also now rotate paper texture and flow maps.  There is a dedicated icon for default settings restoration where you can preserve custom brushes, palettes and paper textures. You can switch between default, single document and presentation views from three different areas (toolbox, window menu, keyboard shortcuts).  They have added the very cool Dynamic Speckles, the speckles in the brushstroke being generated as you paint.  Also new is Audio Expression, brushes that react to sound, using audio from streaming music or your computer's microphone which you can sync to brush controls like brush size, angle, color.  Also very helpful are visual tool tips with illustrations which show how your attempted adjustments will affect the custom brushes applied to your creation. You can now personalize your workspace by modifying the UI color scheme.

My favorite area is working with existing photographs as I'm just better at transforming than creating from scratch.  There is something for everyone, photo artists, traditional artists, illustrators, or just non-categorical individuals who want to have some creative fun.

If you are not already familiar with this type of program be aware that there is a pretty steep learning curve.  Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time just to get started, with possibly hours of viewing tutorials and instructions and practice, practice and more practice....but if you are willing and determined there are many talented and helpful users willing to share their expertise via video on You Tube and other sites.  The place to start is the Corel site itself which provides integrated training which automatically updates based on what you have already viewed on the site.

Another consideration before deciding to purchase Corel Painter is that it does require higher CPU and memory resources, which is to be expected with any advanced graphically intense software, so make sure you carefully check the system requirements.",0

"I have used every Microsoft OS since DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1. Until now my favorite was Windows 2000. XP was pretty solid (after service pack 2) except for all of the security holes. Every time I would need to fix an XP machine it wasn't because of something wrong with the OS itself, but because the machine had virus/spyware/trojans etc. Enter Vista. MS fixed most of the security problems but did so at the expense of performance and stability. Now with Windows 7 you get the best of both worlds. XP was released in 2001 and hardware has come a long way since then, but the OS itself remained relatively static and could only take advantage of newer hardware at a basic level. Vista was an improvement and Windows 7 handles it better still.

I think Vista, although I had few problems with it, will go down as ME 2.0. At the same time Windows 7 will be XP 2.0. People will cling to it and MS will have to kill it off before people will move on to it's next offering, whatever that may be.

With that said I would highly recommend that both XP and Vista users upgrade. Unlike previous upgrades you will actually get better performance and use less resources post-upgrade. A first for MS. Security is rock solid. If XP is swiss cheese, then Win 7 is the wall of China. You no longer have to download the ""patch of the day"" from Windows Update. I haven't played around with Media Player, but Media Center is great for watching DVDs and remains pretty much unchanged from Vista. My favorite features are Jump Lists, AERO Snap (for working in two windows side by side). Networking is a bit easier (especially compared to XP). Performance is much improved from Vista and is comparable to or even faster than XP. Calculator, Paint, and Wordpad have been updated. If you are upgrading from Vista you do lose a couple of progams, namely Windows Mail and Photo Gallery. Updated versions can be downloaded from Windows Update for free. The only downside is that upgrading from XP requires a clean install.

As far as the upgrade process itself goes, it's painless. Just be sure to run the upgrade advisor before you do. All that's required of you is a product key (at the end of the installation) and activation. So all you have to do is pop the disc in, grab a good book, and before you know it you're in computing heaven.",0
"Easy to open envelope included the CD and the card with the activation code. The CD actually installs two different programs with two different desktop icons. I wish the business side was a bit more friendly, like the Premium software. This software easily found last year's returns.",0
"My husband installed this on his laptop for the review first. I actually have not put it on mine yet, mostly because he has a lot more experience with CorelDraw than I do.  (He's the official family geek.)

First of all, the program comes with a downloadable version, so if you don't have a dvd drive on your computer, you are still going to be able to use this.  Many laptops today just don't include an optical drive.

The new feature that had him the most excited was the font manager.  It can tell you if you have duplicate fonts, whether they are fully installed, protected fonts, etc.  This wasn't on the previous version, and it is a huge aid for someone who uses a lot of fonts for websites, etc. In any other program, being able to manage the fonts and see all of the ones you have installed is nearly impossible and certainly going to take a lot more time.
  He was nearly giddy about this program, as there is apparently no other program that is nearly as efficient at managing fonts.  While I found it interesting, it wasn't something that got me nearly as excited as he was.

You can also get downloadable software for photo managing using RAW files called Aftershot.  This was another feature that had him drooling with joy.  This is a feature that you apparently need to download soon after activating your software.

This is a much more affordable option for managing graphics than any other brand.  It's not a subscription to use the software, it's software you actually BUY and install on your computer and you can use it until your computer is so antiquated that the Smithsonian Institute wants it for a display.  No additional fees or what he calls ""hostage fees"".

For those who don't always have internet access, you do have to have an internet connection to activate the software, but you also have to connect again once a month to maintain your activation.  This is apparently to prevent piracy, and is only a minor inconvenience.  Most people are going to access the internet that often without special effort, even if they are working offline.

It's also designed for Windows 10, which is probably the most used OS courtesy of the release method chosen by Microsoft.  I think all of our computers are actually running it, although we may still have one or two old laptops that just have 7 or 8 on them.  Not all programs are necessarily ideal in 10, so seeing this is addressing that issue head on is nice.

When we got this software, my husband had actually just finished a trial of the software, so he's been playing with it for a bit when he had time.  He really is a bit too excited about the font manager portion (okay, I'm boring, I just use like three different fonts, and don't really care about all of those others.  Then again, I like spending time with an old fashioned pen and a bottle of ink on paper practicing lettering by hand.)

CorelDraw is really great software.  For me, the fact that they have training videos is an asset, as I have decided that I should learn to be better at computer graphics and photo manipulation than I am, even if I just want to clean up shots of my granddaughter and daughter.  I'll confess that I really had not been spending much time with graphics software in the past decade, and I'm seriously behind the times in terms of using it.  The interface is user friendly, and the learning curve does not look like I'm attempting to climb Mount Everest in a pair of flip flops.  (That's IF I can get him to hush up as he goes on forever and ever about how wonderful the font manager portion is.)  It might be kind of neat to figure out how to draw and paint in a computer graphics program, without the mess and clutter of paintbrushes and acrylic paint tubes (my usual medium).

I'm excited about having this software and getting it installed on my laptop.  I'm creative in the 3d world, so expanding it into the cyber world would be an interesting and exciting process. Best of all, it is a much more economical option compared to Adobe's offering.  It may seem expensive, but I think it will be worth the expense for anyone who is serious about computer graphics.",0

"Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.",0

"I have been a Trend Micro user for many years, but stopped using their product, when they dropped the Firewall feature in their newest products. I started searching everywhere I could think of, comparing Internet Security programs. I

I compared reports from dozens of sites, and the top 3 kept coming up as the best. I was then able to download trial versions of all 3. I used AVG for 30 days, then moved on to F-Secure. After 30 days of F-Secure, I moved on to a 30 day trial of Kaspersky. After a week or so, I decided to purchase the full version of Kaspersky.

Installing the program was easy. You have to uninstall any other anti-virus programs, including Kaspersky, then simply load the CD. The installation took a few minutes, then updating took a little while more. In less than 15 minutes, I had all my settings set, and I was confident I was safe from online threats.

Since this is the 3 user version, I am able to protect my Desktop at home, as well as my own Laptop, and my sister's Laptop too. Such good protection, for 3 computers, was a bargain here on Amazon.

If you don't know for sure, google the phrase ""Kaspersky Free Trial"", and download the 30 day trial version. If you are happy, uninstall the software, and purchase the program here on Amazon. That way you get to ""Try before you buy"".",0
"This product is considerably faster than the Photoshop Elements and the other components of the Elements series. It's also about 25% cheaper. Insofar as features are concerned there is hardly any difference in their capabilities, but what's astonishing with this particular product is the amazing attention given to the help documentation. This company really wants you to learn their product, as there are differences between this and the other Photoshop-like products. For instance, instead of layers, CorelPhoto refers to them as objects. Pasting an alt-print-screen graphic is subtly different from the way Photoshop does it: you have to select a different option from the Edit menu, ""Copy from Clipboard"". The terminologies used in Corel products are different from Photoshop, but just as sensible. It takes very little patience to get used to them.

There is a price-war going on between top notch photo/drawing programs, and the winner will be determined by how fast their customers learn to use them. Even the free products in this category will have to battle it out in this regard. Expediently educating your customer is the key to success, and CorelDRAW X5 is ahead, for now.",0

On the other hand, the Windows 7 laptop that my son uses is about 18 months old.

I will say that you'd need a graphics tablet and pen to truly appreciate SketchBook, and I'll be picking one up for myself as well. Still, even with just a mouse, you can get an idea of the possibilities and simplicity of use that SketchBook Pro 2010 offers. I give it my absolute highest recommendations.",0

"Owning nearly every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, I'd have to say that one of the many things that HERInteractive excels at is the absence of repetition; Each and every one of their games feels unique and is lots of fun, although some may be more enjoyable than other ones. This one also has a unique location, a ranch in the Arizona desert. While sleuthing and the wild west don't seem like a match in your mind, this game is definitely an amazing edition to the series, and deserves a spot on any detective's game shelf.

Story: 9/10. This game pretty much has two stories. There's the fact that a glowing white horse gallops past the ranch occasionally at night, and when it does, bad things start to happen. There's also the story that an outlaw named Dirk Valentine left treasure somewhere at or near the ranch. As the game went on, the two stories somewhat started to meld together, and it was super exciting seeing Dirk Valentine's treasure hunt progress.

Graphics/Setting: 9/10. For a game that's seven years old, the graphics are still pretty decent even by HERInteractive standards today. Sure, the characters movements are still robotic in this one, but the scenery makes up for it; Which brings me to one of the big highlights of this game, the setting. It was such an incredible idea to put Nancy Drew in the wild west and shortly live the life of a cow girl. The music was absolutely perfect for the setting, and it was a very realistic experience for a pc game.

Atmosphere: 9.5/10. Definitely the best atmosphere of any game up to this point, and possibly of the whole series. The AMAZING music fit the game perfectly, and the backgrounds (not the real pictures), were very realistic, and although I played this game on a computer like all other games in this series, I felt somewhat attached to the game's atmosphere

Characters: 8.5/10. The characters were decent this time around. You have three very different cowboys, and Mary Yazzie, a store owner a couple of miles away from the ranch. They each had their own distinct personalities, I just wish they'd shined through more often.

Puzzles: 8/10. Not way too many puzzles this time around, which for me was definitely a positive. Most of them fit the game, and were a good balance in terms of difficulty.

Ending: 9/10. A somewhat surprising and creepy ending. It's pretty simple, but still took me a few second chances to end the game.

Total (averaged): 8.83 out of 10, rounded to....

9/10.

A truly unique and enjoyable Nancy Drew game, the atmosphere and story is top notch, and this game deserves a spot on any Nancy Drew fan's shelf.",0
"Let's face it: a lot of computer-assisted instruction is just plain lame or worse.

They can suffer from either being rote memorization schemes or over-glorified games or simply textbooks in electronic form.

Rare is a system that truly utilizes what computers can do best to solidly teach concepts.

Rosetta Stone delivers.

It teaches language using multiple sensory inputs (picture & voice) and multiple feedback mechanisms (your voice and hand-eye choices).  It is able to adjust and compensate for your learning speed and strengths on the fly.  It is engaging without being just a game.  And it is able to effectively teach without English--- which is the closest you can get to a dedicated immersion course.

Bottom line:  I am very impressed.  My ten year old loves it, actually WANTS to do the lessons.  I'm having fun with it too, even though languages are definitely not my strong suit.  If you want to learn a language on your own, this is the best way I know to do it.",0
"I actually have had this will maker for a few months. I wanted to play with it and see how it works. Right the start, getting it loaded onto my computer was simple.

You can't go wrong using the Quicken Willmaker Plus 2012.

In addition you'll receive other forms, such as Power of Attorney, Final Arrangements to your survivors, forms for house-sitting, requests for birth/death certificates and many, many more forms.  Too much to list. You also get a book called The Legal Answer Book for Families. Have a legal question? It will answer them for you!

I wasn't too sure whether this was the software for me, but now I am sold. If you need a will or other legal forms, then I highly recommend the Quicken WIllMaker Plus 2012.",0
"I am excited about all of the unique features and effects Painter X3 offers as a piece of graphics software. There are things that can be done in Painter X3 that I have not been able to do with any other graphics program.

Painter X3 is not the type of software that a new user can just immediately jump into, because of the special capabilities that it provides. However, it does not take long to understand the intricacies which separate it from basic illustration software. The first thing I noticed when I jumped into it were the alerts that the layer I was working on did not work with the brush I was using, so I made ""Layers"" the first section of the online User's Guide that I would read. It quickly became apparent what the purpose is of the three different types of layers, so I feel I chose well. Once my understanding of layer properties was obtained, the rest of the program became easily understandable, and I have been progressing through the guide in order since, and loving what this program can accomplish.

Special brushes produce amazing effects. Existing surface paint colors can be combined and dragged with new colors, or they can be excluded from the effects of a new stroke when on a separate layer. The build-up effect of subsequent brush strokes produces an excitingly traditional look. An extensive list of effects options for the Impasto brushes allows for some astonishingly stunning, real-world effects, as well.

Navigating a canvas takes a bit of getting used to when one is accustomed to dragging the canvas around the screen without specifically choosing a move option, but there is reasoning behind it, while manipulating the red view rectangle within the thumbnail image in the preview pane provides a quickly accessible means to make up for any extra step that would be necessary in the workspace view.

For users who experienced what they felt was a drastic change in Painter X2, the upgrade to Painter X3 refines some of those changes, making for a simpler, more efficient workflow, while adding several cool new features, as well.

Corel Painter X3 can be used with a mouse, but it is most efficient when used in conjunction with a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet. Not only will it be easier to express the subtleties of light and heavy strokes, but also users will have much more convenient control over the smoothness and the angles of their brushstrokes.

I love Corel Painter X3. It is possible to come across some instructions in the User's Guide that do not reflect the current Painter X3 environment, but these are subtle items, which are easily identified upon their discovery. Painter X3 is a powerful, unique and fun real-media graphics tool that I am happy to have at my command. I highly recommend Corel Painter X3 for designers, illustrators, artists and hobbyists of all kinds.",0

"I love the program and how easy it makes family genealogy tracking.  It has lots of options and additions; I love the fact that it automatically has a membership to ancestry... enough so that it got me in a mad rush to finish my genealogy before the trial was up.  That being said, it has a few flaws.

1- it's pretty much the same as ancestry.com. I do like having the program ON my computer and not necessarily having to log into Ancestry. But I'm unsure why, other than that, they made a program that isn't any different than their online program.

2- online ancestry is easier to search and get around than the program. I end up doing all my searching online, then syncing my program to the online tree (a great feature, by the way!).  So I wish I could work in the program and search from there but it doesn't work as well.

3- syncing isn't always easy, especially with blending multiple trees. I wish it would blend easier.

"We use QuickBooks for a small business and we have a CPA do our taxes, so we probably could do without upgrading every year. This year, it's worthwhile. The 2013 version has the same expanded interface that was introduced in 2012, keeping customer info visible as you work. It allows you to attach proposals, receipts, and other documents to invoices to help keep data together, and it makes it easy to upload data from spreadsheets. These additions allow you to integrate data more easily, and are a big help for a small business.

Also helpful: batch invoicing. If you have a number of customers using the same services, you can send all their invoices at once, for a significant time savings.

The other new features are a quicker way to reconcile your bank statements with QuickBooks and a new payment option with the Intuit Payment Network.

The look of the interface is a bit different, but workflow is consistent, so there was no real learning curve. If QuickBooks is new to you, though, you'll like the video lessons and Guide Me feature.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Ergonomics & Usability:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 versions of both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro were resolved in this X4 version. It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 PaintShop Pro X4 offers a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 PaintShop Pro X4 combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 PaintShop Pro X4 has a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 PaintShop Pro X4 includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful, for both photo and video editing; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $90.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The PaintShop Pro X4 user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.
 VideoStudio Pro's ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode lets you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.
 VideoStudio Pro has a new time-lapse photography feature to create time-lapse movies from a set of photos shot over a period of time.
 The included proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro X4 works wonderfully to stabilize and remove the shake from hand-held videos.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PaintShop Pro X4 is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 PaintShop Pro X4 has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of the new PaintShop Pro X4 user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the PaintShop Pro software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation for both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.

In addition, the ""Ultimate"" extras that separate it from their non-Ultimate counterparts include: Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, extra ""Picture Tube"" images for use in PaintShop Pro, proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro, Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects, and coupons for WinZip software, Blurb.com photo book, and 21 free image downloads from Fotolia's Web site. If you are really only interested in either PaintShop Pro X4 or VideoStudio Pro X4, but do not want both products, you can just purchase either product in their separate ""Ultimate"" packaging.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.

Even though my video-editing skills rank far behind my photo-editing and graphics design skills, I started using Corel's VideoStudio Pro software when it was at version ""X2"". The VideoStudio Pro X4 version that is included in this software bundle offers powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. But as with the PaintShop Pro photo software, you need plenty of patience to progressively learn all of its features.

The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle's notable product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10. PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.

 This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.

 To help you navigate through the plethora of PaintShop Pro tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.

 PaintShop Pro includes tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.

 The new PaintShop Pro HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating. Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.

Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new PaintShop Pro ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo. This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well. As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.

 The new PaintShop Pro ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas. This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 A new PaintShop Pro ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo. These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 PaintShop Pro has built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email. Likewise, VideoStudio Pro lets you upload movies to YouTube.

 I had fun using VideoStudio Pro's new time-lapse photography feature. I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio Pro X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie. If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

 VideoStudio Pro lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy. The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders. There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks. You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects. Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips. Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips. Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous. This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

 As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment. The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources. You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip. You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks. The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks. While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

 After you have finished editing your video masterpiece in VideoStudio Pro, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime. You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube. The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices. This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities. Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use. This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos. Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie. 3D glasses are included with the software.

 The ""Ultimate"" version of VideoStudio Pro X4 includes proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software that really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The PaintShop Pro user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 I like the changes and improvements that Corel has made to VideoStudio Pro X4. I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively. But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio Pro X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser. With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application. Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

 VideoStudio Pro is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power. But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features. Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease. The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way. This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

 Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 PaintShop Pro X4 now requires only 1GB of disk space. The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 With this VideoStudio Pro X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.

 One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio Pro is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl. These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors. So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio Pro X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

 Back when I was using VideoStudio Pro X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video. Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this VideoStudio Pro X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4. When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio Pro X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old. As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $90.  For less than $100, there is currently no other commercial software that even comes close to the photo and video editing power and features that are offered in this fully-loaded bundle.

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility. But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4. And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

While the VideoStudio Pro X4 included in this bundle lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. And VideoStudio Pro X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity. If this video-editing software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 star",0
"I've used Norton 360 since 2009, except for a 6 month time period about a year ago when I tried Avast-Free which left me with 2 Trojan files that Norton 360 picked up on the minute I re-installed it. Since this is a 3 PC copy, I also installed it on my old desktop PC I use for work projects, and on my netbook. This runs unobtrusively in the background, even when doing a short scan, and doesn't slow any of my PC's down.

Here is what I have mine installed on:

Home Desktop PC: Windows 8.1, 3.4 Ghz Processor, 4 GB memory, Chrome browser
Home Netbook: Windows 7 Starter, 1.66 Ghz Processor, 2 GB memory, Mozilla Firefox browser, latest version
Old Desktop PC: Windows XP Professional, 2.4 Ghz Processor, with only 512K memory

I also think it's smarter to purchase the CD in lieu of downloading from Amazon. I like to have a physical copy in my hand in lieu of a download. Similarly, buy the CD instead of updating direct from Norton's web site. It's always more expensive from Symantec's site than buying a new installation CD here.",0
"Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac provides a fully-featured solution with few if any bugs that I've encountered. It does a lot of updating, but it updates with no problems and I haven't had any loss of data issues throughout my year and a half of using it. Everything has functioned properly... Why can't all of Microsoft's software work this flawlessly? Aside from the rhetorical questions, I see no reason not to recommend this product. If you need an Office suite for Mac, this is a safe way to go.",0

"I just finished playing ""Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon"", and I was literally blown away by the amazing graphics - what an improvement over previous games!  These graphics are definitely on par with the likes of ""Myst"", and other adventure games - although you do have to play for a little while before you get to enjoy them...

This Nancy Drew game is about a young rich girl who had her father restore an old train back to working condition.  There are many rumors surrounding this train - especially since the original owner wound up missing in the mid 1800's, and his engineer was found still in the train, in the middle of the desert, dead...  On top of this, the owners wife had died on the train at an earlier date, so many people thought it was haunted.

The reason the young girl had wanted the train restored was because story had it that Jack Hurley (the original owner), had found gold in a mine - and that the directions to find this mine were all hidden inside the train.  She wanted this treasure, and invited several people (including Nancy and the Hardy boys) to help solve the mysteries, and find the mine.

This is one of those games that ropes you in.  In fact, I couldn't stop playing it!!!

I think it's important for you to know that I am 36 years old - a testament to the fact that these games are great for teens and adults alike!!!

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew Mystery series.  So far, this is hands down the best ND game I've played to date!  Just a note of caution though - I'd suggest you choose the ""junior detective"" regardless of your age, as there are several areas where it's too easy to become stuck, and if you choose this level, you have the benefit of a few more hints and the task journal - both big helps when you find yourself unable to move on...",0
I was first introduced to 360 as a beta tester and enjoyed testing the product. I like the ease of installation. I like Norton products and have used them for years. All the companies I have worked for as a ME secured their PCs and networks. Have never been downed by rogues virus attacks. Will never use the other guys.,0
This is the best S&Ts by far with voice commands and large directional and distance information; connects effortlessly to Magellan GPS. Just came back from a 500 mile trip with it running the whole time.... took me right to the door of a destination I had  never been to before. Accurate every step of the way... excellent voice quality on direction and distance.... One does not even have to look at the laptop screen for an entire trip. Well worth twice the price. What is missing on the pocket PC version is fantastic on the laptop version: the route and the voice info.... so 5 stars for the PC version and 3 stars for the pocket PC version. I still would not be without it for the pocket PC even with the shortcomings.,0
"I haven't finished my taxes with this software yet.  I know it works though.  I switched to H&R Block last year when Turbo Tax got so many bad reviews.  I love H&R Block.  It will be so easy to do taxes again this year.  You can ask advice for free from H & R Block professionals by e chat

"I love McAfee for antivirus and security. It has never slowed down my computer. Their interface is easy to use. I can find out quickly whether it has been running on schedule or not. This was not the case with other companies' software.

McAfee has good customer support as well.

I like that it will protect three computers as well. Makes the cost of the product to be more cost effective.

This is a great antivirus product and I recommend it highly.",0
"Bitdefender works really well on both vista and xp machines, and I really like the clean interface and the fact that it runs pretty low key in the background without excessive popups requiring user responses and it doesn't drag down system resources.  It installs flawlessly, and even will uninstall other antivirus software in case you forgot to do this yourself, which I thought was a really nice touch.  My main criteria for security software is that it needs to run quietly in the background and not hog resources or cause other system issues - which McAfee Antivirus and Norton Internet Security can't seem to figure out how to do.  Before this I used to use Trend Micro PC-Cillen exclusively because it used very little system resource compared to the others, until their latest version which suddenly ballooned into huge resource hog - I don't know if they've fixed that yet or not, I haven't gone back to it since.
  Bitdefender seems to have none of the problems that plague other security software, and I would switch to it exclusively, except on my main PC's I am sticking with Windows Live Onecare, which does the best job of integrating seemlessly into the OS (naturally, since it is Microsoft).
  As far as which is better at stopping viruses and malware, I can't really say, since I am a low risk user and rarely am threatened with viruses and have never accidentally downloaded malware.  I suspect Bitdefender would out perform Windows Live Onecare on this score, which is why I would definitely recommend it to any who doesn't practice safe surfing.
  All in all, it's a very comprehensive security package at a great price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.",0
"For those who have the software and like printing their own checks, it is hard to beat this huge pack of check paper. For a laser printer, they work well with the correct software. They do not have pictures on them, as I feared. Instead, they are just blank pages with a nice subtle bank-like non-forgery design on the whole page.",0
"What else is there to say? Trend Micro continues to make me happy as my antivirus of choice. It does just what I need, and doesn't force itself on me if I don't want it. It doesn't invade my system like other AVs out there, and it works perfectly without being bloated and huge.

If you're looking for a low-cost, high-end antivirus you can't go wrong with Trend Micro.",0
"I am excited about all of the unique features and effects Painter X3 offers as a piece of graphics software. There are things that can be done in Painter X3 that I have not been able to do with any other graphics program.

Painter X3 is not the type of software that a new user can just immediately jump into, because of the special capabilities that it provides. However, it does not take long to understand the intricacies which separate it from basic illustration software. The first thing I noticed when I jumped into it were the alerts that the layer I was working on did not work with the brush I was using, so I made ""Layers"" the first section of the online User's Guide that I would read. It quickly became apparent what the purpose is of the three different types of layers, so I feel I chose well. Once my understanding of layer properties was obtained, the rest of the program became easily understandable, and I have been progressing through the guide in order since, and loving what this program can accomplish.

Special brushes produce amazing effects. Existing surface paint colors can be combined and dragged with new colors, or they can be excluded from the effects of a new stroke when on a separate layer. The build-up effect of subsequent brush strokes produces an excitingly traditional look. An extensive list of effects options for the Impasto brushes allows for some astonishingly stunning, real-world effects, as well.

Navigating a canvas takes a bit of getting used to when one is accustomed to dragging the canvas around the screen without specifically choosing a move option, but there is reasoning behind it, while manipulating the red view rectangle within the thumbnail image in the preview pane provides a quickly accessible means to make up for any extra step that would be necessary in the workspace view.

For users who experienced what they felt was a drastic change in Painter X2, the upgrade to Painter X3 refines some of those changes, making for a simpler, more efficient workflow, while adding several cool new features, as well.

Corel Painter X3 can be used with a mouse, but it is most efficient when used in conjunction with a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet. Not only will it be easier to express the subtleties of light and heavy strokes, but also users will have much more convenient control over the smoothness and the angles of their brushstrokes.

I love Corel Painter X3. It is possible to come across some instructions in the User's Guide that do not reflect the current Painter X3 environment, but these are subtle items, which are easily identified upon their discovery. Painter X3 is a powerful, unique and fun real-media graphics tool that I am happy to have at my command. I highly recommend Corel Painter X3 for designers, illustrators, artists and hobbyists of all kinds.",0
"The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder. I used to prefer Google Desktop search on PCs to Finder, but this upgrade has swayed me to prefer Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!",0

"The year is nearly 2004 and I am still using Windows 2000. I used to be an NT 4 user but 2000 has to be the most solid Windows OS I have had the experience of using. Most software packages will still run under 2000 and so will new ones, even most games.
Windows 2000 is very secure and I use it mostly for hardcore multimedia work. I can count the amount of crashes I have had within almost 4 years using this OS on 1 hand! For the type of work that I do (Video, web, 3D) I need an OS that is going to be put through some intensive processes. 2000 did it for me.
Going with 2000 may not be the best choice for everybody, and XP is probably much better for the domestic home computer user, but if you want a solid system then look no further than 2000. It will not let you down.",0

"Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon... I would definitely recommend you purchase this interactive mystery PC game!!  The graphics are vibrant; the sound effects are very good and add a key element to your game play; the characters are interesting; the clues keep you thinking and looking for answers; and Nancy will not let you down!  She is not afraid to hunt wherever she must!  The train ride seems realistic, as you pass from one car to the next.  You get to use a cell phone camera at some point.  One reviewer said it's too short, however, my experience (as an adult) is that it is just the right length, especially for a $20 game.  I don't try to race through the game, rather I save it and then go back.  It's up to you.  And it is still fun to play the game again, even after you've solved it.  I rate most of the Nancy Drew PC games at 5 stars!",0

"The 2006 Turbo Tax is the best yet.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years now and it improves every year.

I am not sure why anyone still uses someone else to prepare their taxes or does it the old manual way.  Turbo Tax makes it a very simple process.  It leads you through your return by asking questions.  From your answers, it fills in the tax forms.  In the end, it reviews your return for possible errors, missed deductions and items that might trigger an audit.  Last but not least, you can send your return via the internet or print your return and mail it.  If you do it via internet, you get confirmation that your return has been received and accepted by the IRS. (Ever wondered if it got lost in the mail?)  This is about as painless as tax preparation can get.  Give it a try.  I highly recommend this 2006 Turbo Tax version.",0

"The Crime: A -

Bess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch. Now a phantom horse is appearing at night, heralding major accidents. Just before Nancy arrives, for example, Bess's uncle is bit by a rattlesnake and rushed to the hospital. What's going on here?

Suspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.

Fun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.

By this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.

The story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though. Plus there are horses. Horses count for a lot in my book.

Puzzles: A -

Puzzles included everything from baking a cake to solving a little metal maze. The maze drove me insane.

One puzzle in particular made me roll my eyes because the way you find the solution is utterly dumb. You're looking for a really old piece of information, and Bess and George, stuck at the airport, happen to find a book that contains exactly what you need to know. And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.

Gameplay: A +

The new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access. I thought the wide screen was great but the extra clicking irritated me, because if you may miss the little button to close it or change pages. You get used to it, though.

Western life comes alive at Shadow Ranch, where you repair the chicken coop, perform daily tasks and always take care of your horse when you get back to the stable or Tex will have something to say to you!

Other fun in the game includes invesitgating a ghost town, learning to use a lariat (lasso) and completing a barrel race in under ten seconds.

You know how I said that DDI has everything but romance? Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.

Time Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.

Voice Acting: A

Raspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend. Many of the voice actors hear have appeared in other games, so it's a treat for a long-time fan. Superlative delivery, as always.

IGraphics/Video: A +

I've been using this software on my laptop for some time now.  Read what the security experts say and they alway suggest Norton over all others.  Once this software is installed you pretty much let it do it's thing.  Auto live updates keep it current and auto scan can scan your whole system while you sleep.  Get it now while it's cheep since the 2003 version is out and offers limited extras.  Don't have any virus protection now?  Can't get the upgrade rebate?  By McAfee VirusScan Ver 7 as well and you will then have two virus protection schemes to choose from and with competitive upgrade rebates pay nothing for either.,0

"This program is created by the makers of Corel Painter, which many consider to be the best painting and illustration software on the market. This software is a kind of Corel Painter Lite, and as such is a nice way to gain some initial exposure to digital art.

I'm not a particularly sophisticated software user myself, so I was happy to discover that this program is relatively easy to use. I installed it on my laptop, which has Vista, with few problems. The written manual is well done, and the video tutorials are especially helpful.

If you have even a mild interest in art, crafts or photography, this program will give you endless hours of pleasure. You can add special touches to your photos. You can create greeting cards. And if you are a fan of scrapbooking, you should see what you can do with it using this program!

I recommend this program to people of all ages, and it is especially fun for families to use together.",0
"This is my first modification on any type of computer. In fact, I did it incorrectly, and it still worked.

If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on. Power down first, then unplug the device, be it printer, digital camera, external HD, or cordless microphone. It could result in a crash and/or data loss (Thanks to Christine for this word of advice).",0

I still open office docs sent to me in Office, but otherwise I create docs on Pages. If your an Apple fan you can't go wrong here. If your a business user you will probably want this and Office 2008. iWork 08 is not a complete Office replacement yet, especially if you need to send Office compatible docs to Windows users.",0
This was exactly what I needed.  The Company provided good communication in regards to receiving my order and shipping information.  Very pleased,0
"I've been using this for a couple months now, and have found that I have actually eliminated many other programs that I used to use, as this suite is so chock full of content, everything else seems obsolete.

There is a lot going on here, as this version of CorelDRAW is the cream of the crop.  It works very well with the Windows 7 interface, and is fully customizable.  Install only what you need, but if you're like me, I dabble in most everything it offers for subject matter.

I have designed web sites for years, and through these years, there have been many fill-in-the-blank type web site creators.  The web site creation feature alone is worth the money, and perfect if you are not no familiar with programming. In my case, I liked creating with this feature, but the ability to edit anything I want. However, it comes with so many templates and images, you are good to go for your first ever web site, if that is the case.  Soon you will add more to your sites with the Swish program, adding flash animations and text.

Photographers will not only adapt well to the image creation and editing features, but will appreciate the organization of a huge collection of work that would otherwise be hard to navigate.  If you have a mess of photos, and not a pro, even better.  It helps you get to a higher level as you save much higher quality work.

Video Studio is perfect for the aspiring YouTube star that wants to take their audience to the next level. But with the resources and features provided, you could become an avid filmmaker. And if you are already a pro making movies, this program simply makes a lot of aspects much easier. The video effects and the ease of adding music and textual elements are top notch.  And everything is easily uploaded directly from the program, or you can create a stunning DVD presentation.

There are plenty of tools and features that you may think you will not use, but once installed, you will be noticing that these elements are merely incorporated in your work.  The portability of files and sharing is much easier with the industry standard in WinZip Pro which will become your default choice in file compression.  But you will appreciate the organization ability of all these programs on your system with customized toolbars, thumbnail and preview features, and there is no reason to be overwhelmed with the fear of having to learn it all.  If you are like me, you learn by doing. But the fact that there is over two hours of training videos on DVD as well as a plethora of helpful resources on their web sites, this has got to be the user-friendliest suite for the artist in anyone.  I highly recommend this for children as well. If there is a glimmer of an artist in their eye, this is worth the investment.",0
We use this and find it not as cumbersome as McAfee or Norton also a good value when the price is right :),0
"The various Rosetta Stone software packages have garnered a rather impressive reputation over the years as some of the best options for learning a new language without taking classes or hiring an instructor.  Based on the high quality offering of the ""German Level 1, 2, 3"" set, that reputation appears to be well deserved.  The package is far more than just a book on German in digital form, and includes many extra features to make the whole thing worth the hefty price tag.

The three level German language software comes with a USB headset so that the user can listen to the lessons without disturbing anyone around them.  The headset has a built-in microphone that works with the software's speech recognition feature, which lets the user know how they are doing with the language.  A quick-start fold out card is also included, complete with pictures and step-by-step instructions, to get the user started quickly.

The software isn't hard to install, but it is a very long process.  The entire installation could take more than a half hour, especially if the massive web updates are downloaded.  Any decent computer system should be able to handle the software, as the program only requires 512 MB of RAM and 1.8 GB of hard drive space.  Both Windows XP and Windows Vista are currently supported.  There is an interesting option that can be set during the installation to change the software to start with a different language.  The program doesn't have to go from English to German, but can instead begin with several different starting languages.  That alone already makes it more versatile than any German language book could ever be.

Another neat add-on that is included is a set of stickers that can be attached to a keyboard.  The stickers mimic a German language keyboard, which will make typing in German easier once the basics of the language have been mastered.  The user's guide is also exceedingly comprehensive, so any questions about how to use the software shouldn't require a call to tech support.

Once the program is installed and started there are several different course options to choose from.  Each option tackles a different aspect of learning the language, such as reading, writing, and speaking.  The default option is to learn all three at once, but for those who don't have enough time for the full course or are only interested in one of the courses there is the option to remove one or two of the features.
As the name suggests there are three levels to the software, each building on the concepts in the last.  As the user progresses through the program they switch out the CDs to the next level.  The program also comes with multiple audio companion CDs so that the user can practice their German when they aren't in front of their computer.

While the price may be a big deterrent for some, there is enough high quality material in the Rosetta Stone German language software that anyone who is really committed to learning the language should seriously consider it as an option.",0
"I bought this to install on a new Intel NUC system I was building, choosing Windows 10 Pro because I wanted to use Bitlocker disk encryption. The DVD worked fine for the install, but I was momentarily confused as to where to find the product key. Inside the packet is an ""authenticity"" sticker which has a small scratch-off square that hides most of the product key. The type on the sticker is so small that I did not recognize at first that's where the key was and had to use a magnifying glass to read it. Note that you don't actually need the DVD - you can download the Windows Media Creation Tool to create installation media on a USB stick if you want.",0
"This is one of their learning heavy games, and I really appreciate that. It still manages to be extremely adventurous even though you're in the downtown of a big city rather than out in a castle, or a haunted mansion. The knowledge gained in this game is interesting, which is what makes the learning worth while. Just make sure you actually have a notebook sitting out to take notes.

My favorite part of this game is it's ending. It's hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen. As a kid, this ending scared me worse than the Ghost Dogs (of Moon Lake) ever could (I should mention that I got into these games just before this and Ghost Dogs was released, and Message in a Haunted Mansion didn't scare me because I -correctly- guessed at what was going on rather early, since I'd seen it so often before on Scooby Doo).

I mark it as my fourth favorite (1. Treasure, 2. Blackmoor, 3. Shadow at Water's Edge, 4. this one, 5. Danger on Deception Island) and I understand why some people might get frustrated and want to put it down. But, unlike many of the games between 11 and 23, at least it doesn't leave people saying 'that's it?' at the end of it.",0

As it happened everything went reasonably smoothly and I have just what I want i.e. Word, Excel and Powerpoint, provided Microsoft does not try and get more money out of me after the first year this will suffice for another 4-5 years.

"The new WinZip has been upgraded with a variety of useful features. Installation was quick and easy. WinZip has been the consumer standard for compression, and they have branched out and separated the software into various editions including a Courier for email, a self extractor, utilities malware protection and so on. This review covers the standard edition, WinZip 17. This standard has a lot of great new features that make it more useful than ever. WinZip can now convert doc, docx (Word files), xls, xlsx (Excel files) and ppt, pptx (PowerPoint files) by selecting the Convert to PDF box in the Create tab and simply dragging your document into the work area. That alone is fantastic. By selecting options beforehand, you can encrypt your files (Winzip wipes and deletes any temporary files so they cannot be recovered, great protection option). You can right click and create zip files straight from Windows Explorer, sort columns by clicking on headers, processes files such as RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ,TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, LHA, CAB, UUencode, BinHex & MIME files. There are even iOS & Android apps for Apple & Google devices. You can resize images (great for compressing large photos). You can even add Watermarks to your Files with the extensions of BMP, GIF, JPG, PDF, PNG and TIF. The toolbars are very easy to use and are context sensitive, adapting to the task you are working on. Another great new feature is sharing with your social media accounts. You can post any type of file to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn with ZipShare. You can also send large files up to 2GB from your email account with ZipSend.  For me the best new feature is the access to cloud files. WinZip will connect to Dropbox, SkyDrive, Box and Google Drive. You can save a ton of space by zipping files to your cloud accounts or extracting to them. File compression can be customized to your specifications and is quick and fast. I love being able to convert documents to quick PDFs (no it doesn't have the features of Acrobat or Create PDF, but it gets the job done if you need an Office document converted to share or send). The Cloud integration is excellent. Just link WinZip to the service or services you use and you can zip or extract to them in a few minutes. WinZip makes the setup for this a breeze. This is particularly good for large size files or photos since extra space costs $$. I have used WinZip before and this new edition is the best ever. While many complain about the cost, WinZip is really an excellent product. I have tried several other compression programs like 7Zip (shareware) and Power Archiver. 7Zip for me is a great hassle. We have it at work and it is useless because even though it is installed on some machines, co-workers have a difficult time opening files so I never use it. When we had WinZip, everything ran smoothly. It may not be the most advanced compression option, the Pro Version has more advanced features, but it is certainly the easiest to use and the new features make it worth it. Connection  to the Cloud drives and quick PDF conversion are the features I use most often and it is fast and easy. There is also plenty of help available if needed and you can right click for more options. I highly recommend WinZip 17, Corel has stepped up their game for usefulness. A new must have.",0

"I am overall quite pleased with my trial subscription of SendStuffNow Premium. I have already used it 3 times, and have found the service to be quite reliable. Setup was easy on my PC running Windows 7, and the user interface is very intuitive and hassle-free. The product description claims that ""SendStuffNow makes it easier than ever to manage all the large files you need to share. Spanning documents, presentations, applications, images and more, SendStuffNow supports all file types."" I agree with this claim, as I was able to send a variety of files without any hassles. The upload time was not stunningly fast, but that is understandable given the bandwidth that is required for large file sizes. This is the best and most secure way to send files that are too large to include as email attachments.",0

"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.",0
"I use turbotax every year. I think the ""refund bonus offer"" is totally useless. But the basic turbotax (which is what this is) seems to work well and do the computations correctly. Can't ask for much more. It is a bit more clunky every year to use but I can put up with that.",0

"Adobe approved ""Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3, Learn by Video"" is the absolutely best method of learning Lightroom 3 that I've found. It's one on one training presented by Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland. The program truly has just about everything to get you up and running full hilt. You'll progress from the very beginning of setting Lightroom up to importing photos, developing them, exporting them and everything in between. It does not contain everything that anyone would want in an educational program - that would be a practical impossibility. However, this program contains 10 hours of video training: you hear how a procedure occurs and you see how it's done, along with advice and opinion. There's even a testing procedure included and reference booklet. You can also copy selected video tutorials. I've had and have been using Adobe Lightroom for a couple years and recently upgraded to Lightroom 3. I've books written about Lightroom 3 by well known authors but I found reading about it was just a little too tedious and finally decided to find out how to make it work for me. This program works, it did for me and frankly I believe it's the best program available.",0

"The Time Machine restore on our iMac worked PERFECTLY (at home, with the OSX DVD at hand). It backed up all the programs and all the music, videos, photos and documents.  When I ran a restore after getting a new internal hard drive in the iMac, the iMac with the new hard drive was just like it was the night before the hard drive died (except the photo on the desktop was not on the desktop, but still in iPhoto).  I did not have to re-install and update any programs.  All I needed was the Leopard install disk (see update below) and the Time Machine external hard drive.  It took 5 hours to restore everything (193 GB), once I attached the external Time Machine drive to the fixed iMac.

That means if your Mac was lost or stolen, or if your internal hard drive died, you could have ""your old"" computer back as soon as you replaced either the computer or the hard drive.

PS  The iMac was ready with the new hard drive in 24 hours with Applecare.  It turns out that *if* I could not give up the computer right then, I could have bought an external hard drive (""Drive B"" let's call it) and restored to Drive B from the Time Machine backup drive (using the iMac), and I could have started the iMac from that external Drive, at least until I could live without the iMac long enough to get a new internal hard drive.  Same goes for a Macbook, I suppose.

The moral of this story is to use Time Machine and an external hard drive to back up your Mac!  It is so little hassle to back up and such a huge benefit to have.  (Our hard drive was six months old when it died, and it lived a much easier life than a hard drive in a laptop.)  If your hard drive died, you could be back up in 30 hours with a new internal hard drive or 6 hours with a temporary external hard drive (including an hour to go buy the temporary external drive).

My wife's Mom does not have much on her iMac that she cares about keeping.  I did not set up Time Machine  on her computer when I installed Leopard on it.  But after I have used Time Machine for a full restore, it would be so easy to restore her computer to exactly the way she is used to it, that I got an external hard drive for her computer and set her up with Time Machine.

(For your friends with Windows computers:  At the office I use a backup program for Windows called Vice Versa that is  available to download.  Vice Versa is for backing up to external drives, which we do automatically every night, keeping the newest one off-site.  There is also Mozy for Windows, which backs up online and, in theory, is the easiest solution.  But Mozy is slow, even with a cable modem, and you have to pay every year.  A Mozy restore is very, very slow.  Backing up a Mac with a .mac account might be like Mozy.  I never did it.)

Backing up always used to be a hassle.  With Time Machine the only hassle is getting the external drive ($100 to $200) and setting up Time Machine once.  This is such a small hassle and expense for the huge benefit, that it is crazy not to use Time Machine with an external drive. It is worth getting Leopard to get Time Machine.

Note, when you max out the backup hard drive, Time Machine gives you options for deleting unnecessary files, so you don't have to start a new backup drive when the first one is full.  A great feature.

Also, on the 3-year old iMac with OC 10.3, Leopard (OS X v. 10.5) ran much, much faster than version 10.3.  I did not perceive any speed difference from version 10.4 on the six-month-old iMac, nor on two Macbooks running v. 10.4, each less than a year old.

**************
8/08 update.  To do a full restore you need to have the OSX DVD and, for a Mac Air, the outboard DVD player.  We were in Berkeley, needed to do a full restore on a Mac Air, had the backup hard drive, but not the OSX DVD.  Went to Emoryville Apple Store.  Would not loan me a OSX DVD to do the restore.  Did not have any OSX DVDs in stock, so I could not buy one, either. Said that Apple would mail a restore disc to me if I called them, but I had the OSX disk at home in L.A. and needed to use the DVD that day.  (It is the same version of the same OS that came with every Mac Air, so I could not have been sneaking an upgrade.)  Best Buy was out of the OSX DVDs, too, so I could not perform the full restore.  I consider this horrible customer service. Also, the OSX DVD should be optional to do a full restore.  It might make for a cleaner install of the OS, but you should be able to restore without the OSX DVD if you don't have it with you.  And an Apple store should loan you a copy if you already bought the Apple computer, have applecare for the computer, and are not in your home city.

Also, I was 20 minutes late for my Genius Bar appointment in the Emoryville store (the closest Apple store to Berkeley by car -- there is no Apple store within walking distance of the Berkeley campus.  The closest store by Bart is in SF!) on a Sat. afternoon and they refused to help me.  They said make a new appointment for another day and by the way we are booked all weekend.  I begged and my niece begged.  People canceled their times while I stood there and they would not give me the spot, told me to wait until all the people with later appointments were helped (that is, spend the rest of the day and evening waiting for them to -- possibly -- fit me in).  Zero customer service. I was appalled.  I needed a Time Capsule for my niece but I went to Best Buy to get it because I really did not want to spend a penny at the Emoryville store.  But the next morning I needed the OSX DVD (see above).  The store did not redeem itself.

Bottom line is that I love the OS, love Time Machine, and had TWO back-to-backreally bad experiences at the Emorville Apple store, one of which could have been avoided if Time Machine did not require an OSX DVD to perform a full install, or if Apple stores would loan computer owners a copy to perform the full restore.",0

"Whenever anyone asks me which virus protection they should use - this is the one I recommend - for several reasons.  It is fast and light and has no noticeable impact on pc performance.  It is reliable, I put it on my kids computers (and anyone with kids know they are at a higher than average risk for picking up viruses/malware) and they have never had a virus/malware infection on either of their computers.  What I also like is that if you try to go to a site that is dangerous or hosting malicious software it blocks it and puts up a warning sign saying that the site is dangerous - this is a great learning tool for the kids to learn what kind of websites they should and should not visit and helps them learn what they should avoid in the future.  Another must have is the link scanner, so that when you search up a topic, it'll tell you if the search results link to dangerous sites - invaluable in this day and age when so much malware come from poisoned search results.  Also a must have, is a facebook privacy scanner that tells you how to lock down your facebook privacy as much as possible, and also a facebook link scanner that will tell you if that video your friend posted of the gross spider bite is actually a virus.  This too, is a great learning tool for the kids, so they can see what kind of facebook posts are likely hiding viruses.  If a facebook link is safe, it puts a green check mark next to it, and if it's dangerous it puts a red x next to it. If you get it on sale, then you really can't go wrong and it is worth every penny.  I always believe that infection prevention is they key (as opposed to having to clean it up afterwards), and Trend Micro titanium is top notch at preventing infections.",0
"Installed perfectly on Windows XP. Imported last years tax data perfectly.

Manually downloaded information from all my financial institutions, using the correct import file that the firms make available for manual import. (Not the import button in Turbo Tax)

IMPORTANT!  Remember to get the correct file from your broker since the import function button in Turbo Tax does not import your cost basis for stock or options. Unless you do, you will have to fill this out yourself.  Talk about time, and time is money..Get the right file!

I find that there really is no need to buy the more expensive version, this product does schedule C for my business and home office. I used the Home and Business last year and quite frankly found very little difference in the product. Annoyingly, Turbo Tax kept asking me to upgrade.

This year I knew that e-filing would cost and I gladly paid for it since I was afraid of the IRS's human/scan error in transcribing and I only paid $29 for Turbo Tax with State this year from Amazon.

Received my State Refund in a week, and I my Federal Refund in 2 weeks. No extra costs, deposited right into my bank account.

I still use the forms function to fill in most information, since that is quickest.

ItsDeductable software is useless, time consuming and I question the high amounts it gives to used, very good condition clothing. For my purposes, I claim 10% of the new purchase price for a deduction. If a suit cost $125, the donation is $12.50. Come on guys, I've worn the suit--How can it be worth $65? Maybe this is why Turbo Tax sells extra audit protection?  Since I did not pay for ITsDeductable, I still give Turbo Tax Five Stars this year.

My son, the poor college student (sigh), will again file online for free with Turbo Tax, by accessing it from the IRS government website.",0

"I have used McAfee virus protection for many years and it has always worked well for me. One problem has always been the multiple accounts that spring up when we purchase new laptops or desktops. Customer service straightens them out when you ask, but it's a bother. This single yearly subscription is a great solution. The box contains a wallet-sized card with a serial number on it and a larger card with directions in English on one side and French on the other directing you to an activation site. When you go to the site and enter the serial number, you are directed to input your account information or to create an account. It's very easy. The next step takes your computer a while (depending on the speed of your connection), but you can work while the program files are downloading. (It took about an hour on my slow DSL connection.) The installation on my Windows 7 computer was seamless. To install the program on other devices, including MACs, additional PCs, laptops, and mobile devices, you just open a provided McAfee email on the device and download the software. What a great idea!",0

They have good instructions with it and I could probably learn to do better things but I don't have the patience. I wish I did because I feel like this program could be a lot of fun. It's certainly something that could keep you entertained for hours at a time.

This is what I love about CorelDraw.  It gives you 90% of the power of Adobe at 10% of the price.  The interface is more intuitive and Corel does a brilliant job of making the deep feature set of this product as accessible to those of us who do graphics work on a part time basis.

The deciding factor if you make your living doing graphics is the features and CorelDraw is no slouch.  That's why many professionals prefer it over Adobe.

If graphics is a side job for you, then CorelDraw gives you all the tools you'll need, with a intuitive user interface that is much easier to understand and use.",0

"This is the same virus protection I've bought for so many years, so I guess the fact that I don't switch means I find no fault with it.  In fact, with the 2011 version, I had a problem where all of a sudden it said my subscription was running out and I knew I still had months left on it.  I first used McAfee's Virtual Technician online to determine and fix the problem if it could.  If I remember correctly, it then gave me a link to click for a ""live person"" to chat with online, or it advised me to go to the live chat link.  I couldn't believe the care and service I received.  It was fantastic.  With my permission, the McAfee tech guy ""took control"" of my computer just for the purpose of repairing the problem that I had with the McAfee Internet Security program.  I stayed at my computer and watched in awe as my cursor, without my assistance, clicked this and that and new things popped up and screens changed and more clicks and then I'd be prompted to enter information.  They totally fixed the problem with no complaints from me as to the time it took or the knowledge of the tech.  In fact, I then received a phone call asking me to check ""this and that"" under certain categories, especially the subscription expiration date to be sure all was as it should be.

I found the CD of this new 2012 version installed easily and without any problems.  I find the program works perfectly.  I do notice a slight slow down when it is scanning while I'm using the computer but nothing of any great significance.  All in all, I have no complaints about this product so that means this definitely deserves the 5 stars I gave it.  I'm not at all computer savvy so anything concerning installs on my computer that turn out to be easy and without any hitches and, anything that can be fixed relatively easy by the manufacturer IF there is a problem, is the best thing in the world in my book.

One of the features, the ""Quick Clean"" tool that cleans up unnecessary files, etc. on your computer, is something I really find useful.  I'm sure I'll be buying this same McAfee virus protection product next year from Amazon.",0
"Windows Vista truly is a step backwards.  After running it on three different high-end systems, and switching back to Windows XP on two of them and Ubuntu linux on the third, I can confirm what everyone else is saying: Stay with Windows XP as long as possible.

And I'm an MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer), so I should be towing the company line, but simply cannot:

Here are the primary issues I experienced:

- Lack of stability - Vista running Media Center remains operational for a few days, then slows down to a crawl.  Rebooting may or may not solve the problem.  Windows Defender also crashes at startup, and the computer will periodically blue screen.  No rollbacks, driver updates, BIOS updates or anything else help.
- Speed - Vista is significantly slower than Windows XP at everything - games, Internet connectivity, file operations, everything.
- Drivers - Per IDG, there are simply no Vista drivers for 72% of peripherals released in the last year, and only 4% of peripherals released within the last three years has a Vista driver.
- Security - Windows XP with a good security suite like Trend Micro or Kaspersky is easily as secure as Vista, without the constant popup messages about program actions.  And do you really want Microsoft providing security software to cover the holes that they have left in the operating system software that they are providing?!?
- Cost - It is becoming increasingly clear that other options, like Macintosh, are starting to provide the flexibility to over come the usual complaints about them - they can now run Windows XP natively alongside MacOS, and get all of your productivity intact.  It's best to seriously consider going over to Mac land and seeing what they have to offer you!
- Lastly, DRM. Microsoft has written draconian DRM into every part of the operating system.  No more ripping DVDs for you!  No more trying yo copy
the music you bought and have it automatically loaded and converted to MP3!  NOOOO...Now you only have protected WMA tracks, which only YOU can listen to.  Or even better - try to play an HDDVD or BLURay on your system, experience the joys of downleveling.  Behind the scenes, Microsoft will intentionally degrade your video quality, unless you spend much more to buy ""secure"" versions of your motherboard, DVD-Drive, Monitor, and cabling that make piracy harder, and your life much harder.

Stick with XP as long as you can, and investigate the alternatives like LinuxMCE and MacOS; Microsoft has seriously dropped the ball, and service pack 1 is not going to address the issues.  It's time to look at other options for operating systems.",1
"I am completely amazed at all of the negative reviews regarding this product.  I'm a recent Mac convert and was devastated if not completely amazed that no company has really created a blow your socks off financial suite for the OS.  I have tried every personal finance software for the Mac that I could find, either via google or the app store.  This included, SEE Finance, MoneyWell, Money Dance, iBank, YNAB to name just a few.  Nothing, and I mean nothing connected to my banks (which have direct download) as smooth as the Quicken for Windows did.  The last straw was one of the programs actually reported your available balance on a credit card in it's summary as your balance owing.  The solution was to make a manual entry initially to ""force"" it to report correctly.  Not gonna happen.

So, out of sheer desperation and being willing to toss away $19 on this download I went for it.  I have to say, what is wrong with you people?

This worked FLAWLESSLY the first time for me.  Every bank was found and every account was downloaded perfectly that I wanted it to.  As a matter of fact, it also grabbed one of my banks that has a loan and it grabbed my insurance bill!  Even the Windows version wouldn't do that.  But as I type this in, I'm staring at my updated and downloaded loan balance.  FANTASTIC!

Another brilliant idea is the section where you can review all transactions downloaded on one screen and not have to move from account to account.  Budgeting seems simple enough and will work for me.  Nothing else I tried even came close to the effectiveness of this ""essentials"" stripped down version.

For $19 this is an absolute steal.  When iBank and others want $59 or even more, forget about it.

I have been with Quicken since the DOS days and then moved on to Money (which I thought was a better product) then back to Quicken on m PC.  I have to say, I'm very, very pleased with this purchase and the fact that I don't have to spend the money on an upgrade for my Windows version that would have easily cost more than $19.",0

"The sage 50 Accounting installation was straight forward on my windows xp Home pc. It asked to install or remove previous versions and had a choice of manually or automatically configuring for the firewall. It also asked if installation was for a single computer or network. Most normal installations would assume the defaults, which makes it easy to install for the average user. The entire install took approx. 20-25 minutes.
I received no errors, nor had any issues with the install.

Upon completion, the program opened and wanted me to setup a company. It again was straight forward to setup. It did have an option to convert a company from an existing accounting program. I followed it thru the series of questions, but never got to what type of accounting programs it could convert. So, instead I followed the template of building it from a sample business. It did have a beginners (new to sage) instructional. All in all - the setup was easy and now I'm looking forward to using it for my companies accounting.  Over all probably recommended for some one who knows some basic accounting.",0
"TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great time saver for those due a refund. If you owe money, you might want to save a few dollars and just file manually. The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and there's no real advantage to electronically filing if you're writing a check.

Please note that this version is good for Federal returns only.  It's a bargain if you live in a state with no income tax, but if you live in one of the many states that require a return every year you'll be happier with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2007-Premium-Federal-State-Win-Mac/dp/B000WQ10LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2007 Premium Federal + State (Win/Mac)</a>

"First things first - I was able to easily install the software following the directions provided.  This is somewhat significant in that my DH is a technical person and I've done very little of this on my own.  Of note is that 600 mb is needed for each of the Language Levels.  I did struggle and had to ask for help installing the headset/microphone, but the techie had little difficulty and I'll admit I surrendered to offered help too quickly and believe I may have been able to do that on my own as well.  I write this only for those of you who may be intimidated by programs and are hesitant to buy something for fear you won't be able to figure out how to install and use it.

I'll confess I haven't gotten very far at all with the program and can't tell you that I feel confident I'll be understanding written and spoken Spanish and speaking it fluently any time soon - but I do have hope that this program is what help me improve beyond my current very minimal level.  Incidentally, you have the option of modifying your lessons so that you can choose to learn speaking only, speaking and listening, speaking, reading and listening, etc., although they recommend selecting it all.  I was tempted to select speaking only, but decided if I was going to do this, I may as well do it thoroughly.  Finding the time is going to be the biggest challenge, but I have been heartened by the relatively short - 30 minutes - time for each lesson I've encountered so far in Level 1.

I find the immersion concept of teaching to be an interesting one and am hopeful their methods will be effective.  I especially like the use of images as I think that serves as visual reinforcement and greatly assists in remembering.  I'll update my review as I make progress with the program and see how well I'm absorbing and retaining what I'm taught.  So far, I've been impressed with everything I've encountered.  I was very concerned that I may not follow through with the program, but I have found it to be an appealing way to try to learn something new in a new way at an age when my learning skills are rusty.",0

"I've recently been reading a ton of complaints around the web about the Symantec Norton Antivirus and Internet Security Suite of software. The following little review has been written in response to those complaints:

One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.

With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.

Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec. Nevertheless, despite these pitfalls, as long as I can keep upgrading for free and my systems remain virus-free, Norton is my source for internet security.

"I have used several paint programs including the Corel Painter X3 which is intended for more serious and professional applications. The Corel Painter Essentials 5 provides a set of nice features for general photos touch-up and artwork painting. I like its simple user friendly interface which requires very little learning to use. The program also works nicely with my Wacom tablet.

On top of its standard painting tools, the program also has an auto-paint feature which automatically enhance our photos with various styles and effects. I found this feature pretty fun to use for adding artistic effects to the photos.

If you are looking for a good painting software for general photos touch-up and effects, these would be a good one to consider.",0
"I originally became interested in Italian when I visited there a couple years ago.  At the time, I just wanted to learn enough to get by in the event that I was in a situation where there wasn't an English speaker.  So, I purchased the drive time italian audio CD's and tried to learn from them. I was very unimpressed with them and felt like ten hours of CDs got me little more than the ability to say hello and goodbye.

Being in Italy spurred me into wanting to actually learn more of the lesson, so when Rossetta Stone 3 was made available I jumped at the chance to go further. So far, I can say that this is leap years ahead of the drive time italian course.

This product allows you to customize it to your goals (read, write, listen, speak) through a very simple startup screen (which can be setup for different users) and then it automatically builds the lessons for you.

I find the lessons to be enjoyable and very useful.  The speech recognition aspect is awesome.  It lets you even customize how precise you want the software to grade your pronunciation.

Aside from the computer aspect, this product provides a whole set of CDs that complement the main software.  This is great for reinforcing your learnings when you aren't in front of the computer.

The downsides of the product do NOT outweigh the upsides in my opinion. However, I should list a few for you. 1) It is pricey. 2) It doesn't allow you to run it on more than one computer (you can move it to a new computer, but you have to uninstall it from the first computer). 3) The included headset is a bit flimsy.

Bottom Line: If you are wanting to learn the language, excel when presented with multiple ways to learn it (visual, auditory, and written), and want to do it at your own pace, I really think this is a great option and can recommend it.  If you are only wanting to pick up the bare minimums for surviving travel in Italy and are on a budget, find another product that focuses on getting you into the basic phrases you'll need.  Overall, a great product.",0
"Power Director Ultimate does a wonderful job helping you edit your videos.  By going to Directorzone.com, you can also view training videos to help you get started if you are new to using the software.  Plus, there are thousands of other users who post free templates and provide up-to-date advice to help almost anyone improve.  This online community is very helpful for beginners and advanced users.

As with any software, there is a learning curve but you have access to a lot of free training.

"Some years I have problems installing or getting the updates to work.  But this year everything went just right.  Even my import from Quicken went without a hitch.  it is a beautiful thing when the import from Quicken matches the statement from my broker to the penny.

Printing copies both on paper and to a .pdf file went very well.  Maybe part of all this ease of use was related to the fact that I did NOT import last year's data in.  I started basically with a fresh install and didn't import the TurboTax file from last year.  It all did seem a lot cleaner.

Of course as others have noted do be prepared to spend an additional 19.95 to e-file with your home State.  Also, the 10% added to an Amazon gift card is a really nice bonus.

"Imagine this: you're snowbound in a fancy Wiconsin hotel where you're supposed to be on a ski vacation. The manager just told you someone vandalized the historic library... and you're one of the only four people who made it to the hotel! There's Lisa Ostrum, the journalist who seems a bit too eager to become your friend, Jacque Brunais, a ski instructor from France who just lost the Olympics and is convinced something in the hotel will restore his name, Professor Hotchkiss, an old French teacher who is convinced that Marie Antoinette was a good-hearted person and is destined to prove it, and Mr. Egan the hotel manager who apparently has a criminal record and ties to this hotel. Now you feel it's up to you, as Nancy Drew, to question suspects and unveil a new page in French history.

Out of the so far 13 Nancy Drew games, this one is one of my all-time favorites because the story is so good! This game was pratically flawless!

"I was forced to order Corel PaintShop Pro X4 when I reinstalled X2, and found out that Corel would not support it with necessary updates. A strike against Corel, as far as I am concerned.

I had a little difficulty with the new layout using tabs, but once I sorted through that and got used to it, I was able to do photo editing much as I had done on X2.

X4 does seem to load more quickly, but it sometimes freezes up on my HP 64 bit laptop running Windows 7 SP1, with 4 GB RAM and an Intel Core 2 Duo T6600 2.20 GHz. This is disappointing to me, as other programs run with no problem. I might add that X2 was also freezing up, and that was why that I had tried to reinstall it.

So far, I am satisfied with the overall performance of X4 for the things that I do. I have not tried any of the new features as of 02-22-2012.",0

"I don't know why I get caught up in photo editing software. I have several inexpensive and free photo editors. I had used Serif PhotoPlus (the free version) and recently purchased Serif PagePlus X4... that impressed me! The next step was to buy Serif PhotoPlus X4. So far, I haven't been disappointed. This installed without any problems (PagePlus balked at my efforts but it's fine now). My copy of PhotoPlus required registering it (on-line or by phone). I registered it on-line and then I was able to open the program and see how I liked it. I like it! I also have Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 and so far, I have to rate these as being equal... but I haven't had time to really give PhotoPlus a workout... so I'll see how it goes. Meanwhile, if you are looking for an inexpensive ""professional"" editing tool that's fairly easy to use, this is certainly a good value for the money. I liked PagePlus and PhotoPlus so much that I ordered Serif DrawPlus X4 (I have two earlier versions of that). Recommended!",0

"I used Norton 360 for years and this is apparently the evolution of that software.  I now have it on all of my Windows computers and my Android cellphone.

I can't pay my bills easily without the password vault that keeps all of my passwords memorized and protected.  I have never found 1 password that makes all systems happy.  They have different requirements that some have to be 14 characters long but others are only 7, some need symbols, and others can't have symbols.  Its confusing but with this, I do just remember 1 password, the password for my vault.  If I actually need to see it I just log into my vault and then go to the details on that login.

I haven't ever had any problems with viruses in my life but I've run Norton most of my life so I don't think that's a coincidence.  I've gotten notification of things blocked or quarantined but never had any major problems so I trust Norton.

With all of the threats today it is more and more important to use good anti-virus software.",0
"I was skeptical that an entry-level product would really allow me to create animations, but Anime Studio delivers the goods. It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

OK, now for my input device recommendation: Anime Studio has good drawing tools. Lots of animation work requires precise placement of points, drawing of paths, etc. You really want to use a tablet.

"First time user of the product after a decade+ of using TurboTax. The TurboTax price increases finally got me to give this a try. TaxCut is different but functional... and it works. Got my refunds. Only complaint was at printouts. For some reason it thinks you've got legal sized paper and gives you no choice to print a copy otherwise. It prints out a page plus a remnant page for each actual document page. Also, the text at the bottom of the pages are cut-off. Best bet is to save as a .pdf and print outside the program.",0
"The following review is written under the umbrella idea that CorelDraw Suite is one of the best I have ever used and I can not stand going without it.  However, it is not without its frustrations.  This version is better than previous versions in many ways.  I will attempt to list a few of my frustrations here so if you run into them, you are not surprised.  Still the program is worth it and I highly recommend it.

I tested the 64bit version, it also comes with 32bit as well.
---------------

CorelDraw- a topic in my household since version 3, which is a very long time ago.  I was so excited about checking out the new X7 version that I could hardly stand it.

WHAT WAS I THINKING?

Okay, so CorelDraw is notorious for having some crazy bugs in it.  More than one graphic artist has asked in a variety of ways, what kind of sparkling mind designed some of the things in each new addition.  Some use more choice words than others.

I have had pretty good results with most of the newer versions of CorelDraw over time.  I have encountered some pretty odd quirks from time to time, including some which have been downright embarrassing if not caught before submitting documents.

However, this time around, I figured with the 64 bit version- WOW this ought to really be FAST.

And it is.

I guess the exciting part is that this time around I can rush more quickly from one ANNOYING BUG TO THE OTHER without having to wait as long as before.  I mean, REALLY.  I realize that the updates have not been released yet, so please take this review with a grain of salt.  I am sure updates will be released that will fix some of this stuff.....I hope.

COREL DRAW
First of all, the program is a lot faster.  WHEE!  At least I can run through things a little more easily.  Until the program reboots itself, of course.  Do NOT get me started.

CorelDraw has a great amount of features in it.  It is a wonderful graphics program and one would hope it will work out well often enough so that you don't have to get too frustrated and don't slow your work load down too much.

This time around, well, to begin with, I was editing some documents that I did in a previous version- CorelDraw X5.  It was not THAT long ago that the program was out, so I didn't think I should run into too many problems.

Guess again, sucker!

Here is a list of my first exciting day with this new version:

Outline Tool:
Where did it go?  I looked everywhere for it.  I went to the help files.  I went everywhere and the places it was listed did not tell how to install outlines or change the color- very basic tool.  After a half hour of looking and experimenting- I found it.  It is a bit random and didn't make any sense to me, but once I got the hang of it, I was good to go.

Printer bugs:
I have two printers on my system.  I have an HP Envy 4300 and a Officejet K550.  I have not had any issues with these printers on any other program or system- except CorelDraw.  The program will suddenly cause an issue and then shut down the complete program.  If you plan to use this program until there are updates, PLEASE SAVE YOUR WORK CONSTANTLY in case it decides to shut down BEFORE it backs up your file as you work.

OUTLINE TOOL- AGAIN
It used to be if you highlighted any text - either artistic or paragraph that ONLY THAT TEXT would change color, but not any more.  Outlines and text color will not only change on the word you highlight, but on the entire document contained in that box.  TALK ABOUT ANNOYING.  Then you have to go change the other text BACK where you want it.  ARGH!

Just when I was about to give up on the whole thing, I tried one more time- and VOILA!  It worked.  I got confident that all was well, and BAM back to random again.  It seems that there is a bug when you access the fill for text from the tool bar vs the text properties dock on the right side.  I plan to explore this further.  Since I am not allowed a lot of time to test this extensively, I am just giving you what I have discovered in the few weeks of using it.

PREVIOUS FILES
When I have chosen some files that I have previous worked on in CorelDraw X5, get ready for a fun ride.  First of all you have to have the files converted to the new font/text engine in X7.  If you don't you will get some odd performance from the file if you try to edit or print.

Then if you try to print the files after working on them a bit- or not- even if used as is- sometimes a page will randomly print really really tiny and then no other pages in the document will print that way- even though they all print fine on previous versions.  So here you are with a document that suddenly goes into micro mode.  It took a lot of effort to get it to print normally again.  Better to start that page over, but again, TIME CONSUMING.

PHOTO PAINT
This is where the 64bit improvements really start to become interesting.  In past versions, sometimes when I wanted to do some photo work, I would open quite a few photos and work between them.  It was clunky and frustrating at times.  Also at times, I found that the system would choke and I might have to restart the program.

This time around, the program is much easier to work with.  The photos are all laid out in a much nicer manner.  Each photo is like a file folder which has a tab at the top.  Moving between photos is much easier and quicker.  I LOVE that feature.

Also, I have opened photos which were adjusted with previous versions of Corel Photopaint and was very surprised at how much nicer they turned out.  I find that the tools are more efficient and end up with much nicer results than in some previous versions.

I have been working extensively with CorelDraw and am still very pleased with this version.  Despite some frustrating bugs, the 64bit version is faster and seems to be more efficient especially when dealing with photos.

FINAL COMMENTS
There is so much I can comment on with this program and so much that I would like to talk about.  However, Amazon only wants limited review space, so I will stop there.

Despite the frustrations, I expect some of them to be corrected with future updates.

I have seen better performance in the photo area but also the options for the Draw area as well.  The documentation and training videos available are helpful and extensive if you want to take the time to use them.  It is also intuitive for learners who like to dive in, but some things can be hard to locate and figure out without looking it up.

I highly recommend CorelDraw Graphics Suite X7.  The improvements are worth any frustrations.

"This is the second game in the Nancy Drew software series that I've tried (I've also played ""Message In a Haunted Mansion""), and this was by far the more difficult of the two.  In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from ""The Secret of the Old Clock"", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on ""Display"", then clicking on the ""Settings"" tab, then clicking the ""Advanced..."" button, then clicking the ""Performance"" tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to ""Full.""  Then you'll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!  All in all, this is a very fun game for teenage girls and young women (and hey, guys too!), great for friends and family members to play together, and just an all-in-all wonderful game.  I hope Dreamcatcher and HER Interactive make more of these!",0
Easy to order and check out. Great item and price. Shipping quick as expected. Thanks very professional.,0
"I have read nearly all of the negative reviews and I cannot understand why these people are having so much trouble. My experience is the complete opposite. I have a late model HP 17 inch laptop computer with a 64 bit Intel chip, an eMachines computer with a 32/64 bit AMD processor and a home built Intel i7 64 bit system with a Gigabyte Extreme motherboard. I have Windows 7 running on all my computers all 64 bit except for the eMachines computer. I have never encountered even one problem installing or using PowerDVD 10 or 11. Now I do maintain my computer and regularly do registry cleans and run the disk cleaner application. But everybody should be doing that routinely anyway. I even have Intel solid state disks on my laptop computer and my Intel i7 computer. All I can say is I've never encountered any problem whatsoever. I've even used it with yet another AMD Vista 64 bit computer in China. Never had a problem. And I do test and try out all the various options, too. I use the HDMI output on my XFX video card as an input to my 65 inch Panasonic HDTV. Works great. The claim that they can change the resolution to HD is sort of a marketing joke. Garbage in, ever so slightly better garbage out. If your video was shot in the 1980's, nothing is going to make them look like it was shot in HD. It just doesn't work that way. This is marketing hype, technically accurate statement, but still chiefly hype.

My main complaint is that Cyberlink creates a new version out of trivial improvements, such as from Version 10 to 11. There just isn't that much of an incremental change to warrant two different versions.  And the upgrade price is just way too expensive, especially considering how little difference there is. We will be at version 99 soon at this pace. They should give the updates away free like Microsoft does. And this is much more of an update and tweak than a version change. In my opinion Cyberlink is price gouging just because they can. They have the only truly functional Blu-ray DVD player. If there were credible competition, the price would drop like a rock.  There is competition, but they aren't exactly cheap either.  Cyberlink should offer a family plan where you can use the software on multiple home computers.  I have four legal copies and it is just not right to pay for each one when I am only using one computer at a time.  Instead, I have to pay for each computer.  This should be licensed to individuals as a home license, not per machine per person.  So my complaints are all about their marketing plan.  I believe the product quality itself is top notch.",0
"This is a great software package for anyone just starting their family research or someone who has only basic needs. It does come with a free one month subscription to ancestry.com, and allows you to document your research by creating your own family tree.

All in all, this is a great package for beginners and would also make a great gift, at a very reasonable price.",0

"There are other genealogy programs out there but this is one of the better designed ones, especially for people new to the field. And with the six month subscription to Ancestry.com, the software essentially pays for itself. Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org are two of the best online genealogy resources and this software helps you use both, especially if you don't want to work online 100% of the time. You can create files by importing and transferring previous files from other sources, such as GEDCOM, too, so if you are not new to this, the software is still useful.

That said, the navigation is good, but not always intuitive and there will be frustrating moments. But that is part of the pain and joy of family history research anyway. One of the more pleasing features is the ability to download images easily from the web--like census pages--and add them to your file. The software is strongly tied to Ancestry.com obviously, but it is a great resource, primarily if your family has been in the US for several generations at least. Otherwise, you will need an expanded international subscription and are going to face more frustrations--not associated with this software!--trying to find the information you want about those who came before you.",0
"I have one little program that I need to run, one day a month, each month every year. I have messed around with Bootcamp and every time I try to load windows I feel like strangling my kat. Sorry Santa ""Claws"".

But Parallels Desktop 7 for Mac, is wonderful. Not only does it work, but the instructions are easy, the loading is easy and not having to reboot from Snow Leopard into windows is a dream. And I never use that word to describe software. Just click on the windows program you want, windows loads and runs the program. And when you done windows shuts down and as far as I can tell, there is no memory or cpu cycles wasted once windows logged off. I have not found any problems with this way of using windows, all my Mac hardware is compatible.

What a perfect solution to the Bootcamp grief.",0
"Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon... I would definitely recommend you purchase this interactive mystery PC game!!  The graphics are vibrant; the sound effects are very good and add a key element to your game play; the characters are interesting; the clues keep you thinking and looking for answers; and Nancy will not let you down!  She is not afraid to hunt wherever she must!  The train ride seems realistic, as you pass from one car to the next.  You get to use a cell phone camera at some point.  One reviewer said it's too short, however, my experience (as an adult) is that it is just the right length, especially for a $20 game.  I don't try to race through the game, rather I save it and then go back.  It's up to you.  And it is still fun to play the game again, even after you've solved it.  I rate most of the Nancy Drew PC games at 5 stars!",0
"I just finished playing ""Secret of the Old Clock"", and I loved it!  Before I say anything more, I think it important to add that I am 35 years old - so, take it from me, these games are great fun for ANYONE over the age of about 10!

This particular game is set in the 1930's (the depression era), and is about a young girl whose mother recently passed away - leaving her a bed & breakfast/bakery to run.  She did, however, write her friend before passing, asking her to come & help her 17 year old daughter if something should happen to her - and her friend rushed right over, trying to help out, but knowing nothing of the business.

Strange things started happening at the inn at about this time, and both the young girl & her guardian are convinced that she is having a nervous breakdown - that it's all in her head.  Especially since not only is she grieving the loss of her mother, but they are running out of money.  An elderly neighbor (who was quite rich) had promised to leave them plenty of money in his will - but when he died, it looked as though he left all of his money & estate to a man who supposedly taught mind reading & esp.

In comes Nancy Drew...  Is the will originally found the ONLY one?  Could it be a forgery?  And what of all the strange noises & happenings at the inn?  Who's behind them, or are they really all in the teenager's mind?  These are the questions you'll have to answer while playing ""teen detective"".

I found several differences between this game & the other Nancy Drew games I've played to date.  First, the graphics are better - in fact they are just as good as some of the more high-tech games I've played.  Second, you actually get to drive a car (but be sure to watch out for potholes)!  Last, there was much more ground to cover - which I really liked - so you get to see a lot of the town, and speak with several people (rather than just being confined to a house, and only talking to 1 or 2 others).  Oh, there's one more difference...  You actually have to earn money in this game - to pay for gas, car repairs, games & other necessary items.

Overall, I think this game is a ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys (or had enjoyed) the Nancy Drew series.  One of the great assets of these games is that they allow you to choose a difficulty level - but, I must warn all you other adults out there, if you haven't played many ND games (or even if you have!), you may want to choose the ""junior"" level.  This will allow you to get more hints if you need them - and if you don't, you just don't ask for them - as it's the number of hints that will change based on the level you choose to play at.

Another 2 thumbs up for the creators of Nancy Drew!!!",0
"We get the upgrade every year, and, while the changes are not huge, the program is excellent to begin with, and they do improve it every time.  This is no exception.  The program seems a bit faster, and there have been some tweaks in the way things work.  Nothing major by itself, but it adds up.  This has always been the best genealogy program, in my opinion, and it still is.",0
I get free wifi from the library across the street and download bit torrents all day with this thing....great deal!,0
"The ninth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. This is my favorite game, so I'm gonna go nuts here. Things are graded A-F, just like school.

The Crime: A +

Nancy tries to take another vacation, this time by spending some time on Katie Firestone's whale watching boat in Snake Horse Harbor. The minute she arrives, plans change! Katie's boat has been vandalized. An orphan orca has shown up in the bay and there are different opinions as to what to do with it. Did Katie's big mouth get her in trouble?

Suspects include fisherman Holt Scotto, cafe-owner Jenna Devlin, and rival whale watching tourguide Andy Jason.

I'd never had a chance to learn anything about whales or the ocean and thought this was an endlessly cool premise.

Puzzles: A +

Nancy has to figure out everything from nautical terms to knots to Morse code. People give her tasks and quizzes. It can be as easy as making a sandwich or as hard as traveling underground tunnels and counting rocks.

Gameplay: A +

This game has it all. You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.

The only thing missing is maybe romance. But you get to talk to Frank and Joe Hardy on the phone, so that's close enough. (I love those boys.)

Time Changes: None.

Voice Acting: A +

In a word, perfect.

Favorites -

""Ah. Nuts."" Andy Jason

""Next one'll be on the house, too."" Jenna Devlin

""Vote for Holt!"" Holt Scotto

Music: A +

I loved, loved, loved the music. The travel music was jaunty and perfectly fit the ambiance of the tiny seaside town. Especially cool was the little flute trill that occurred as you finished a puzzle.

Graphics/Video: A +

Getting better and better all the time. Bonus points for the animated sequences such as the whale watching tour.

Technical: B

I'm one of a few people who have had this problem, but no matter what I did, DDI wouldn't fully install on my computer. There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.

Overall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.

If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. All-time favorite.",0
"I've used Microsoft products for over a decade, and just recently switched to the mac. I couldn't be happier. iWork too has been a pleasant surprise. It took me literally hundreds of hours of frustration to learn the ins-and-outs of Microsoft Office, and I even took a couple classes in college that dealt with Office. Within two days of using iWork, I was creating the best looking documents I've ever made. iWork is intuitive and fun to use. AND THE ONLINE VIDEO TUTORIALS ARE AMAZING. Be sure to watch them. I love Apple, and am just angry that I didn't make the switch years ago.",0
"I have never worked with video editing, or burned CD/DVD except for drag-and-drop operation to backup files. After working with this package for a couple of days, I think it is absolutely great for the casual user who wants to create some nice looking video packages.

Pro:
Very powerful. One can edit each individual clip down to the frame, then integrate it into the project. There are separate tracks for video, overlay video, titles, sound, and voice over. The included effects allow one to create professional looking titles and basic video effects. To operate the program, one simply imports the video clips, sounds, etc. onto a working area, then drags the appropriate item into the timeline. It supports blu-ray and DVD burning. I don't have a Blu-Ray burner, so I only burned DVDs.

There is an express interface for those who want to avoid the complexity of the full timeline interface. I quickly went to the detailed menus to do what I wanted; if you have any experience with Flash (which uses the timeline style construction), you will have no problem working with this software.

A separate burning package is included called DVD Factory Pro; it is run from within the X3 software. It does a good job of rendering and burning. It is fully capable of using multi-CPU, and I found that my quad core AMD worked a LOT faster than my single core Pentium!

The program makes use of the hardware on the video card for faster display while working, including using smaller size images if desired. So all of the PC hardware can be utilized.

The program offers to let you download DVD Factory 7 SE, which is a stand alone program very similar to the DVD Factory Pro, except that one cannot access the DVD Factory Pro except from within the X3 program. I'm not sure that it was necessary, but it is nice for a quick burn project.

Con:
There is some inconsistency in how the software finds it's source files. One has to navigate to get videos, for example, and then when you want to open a different kind of file, it remembers the video location. It would be much better if it remembered separate locations for the different kinds of files. It was quite frustrating; I ended up opening folders for each of the data types, so I could simply paste in the folder location quickly. Once the files are inside the program there is no issue.

There is no indication inside the main program of how much space the project will take when it burns to DVD, and even the burner application does not tell you until you actually get to the final screens. It seems to me that the original program should be able to calculate the space being generated, so one could cut down the project to fit - before starting the burning program.

Conclusion: Excellent package. It will take a bit of time to learn all the features, but even a novice like me can make really great looking videos using this software. Highly recommended.",0

"Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium is a high-end speech dictation software package. This was my first experience with such software. This review was written using Dragon. My experience is limited to a few hours with this software.

Installing Dragon was simply a matter of placing the CD in the drive and following standard installation protocol. The package included a CD with the software, a quick start guide and a microphone headset. It loaded successfully on the first try and so far has shown no tendency to nag for registration or other issues. It does ask for permission to scan documents allegedly to improve performance of the software. I don't believe these are scanned for content but rather for language structure and complexity in order to improve the algorithms. These requests are generally non-intrusive.

My installation was on a Dell workstation laptop using a high-end Intel core I7 processor, with 16 GB of memory. After installation was complete it asked me to read a sample text in order to tune the recognition algorithm. It periodically offers to scan documents and emails for unique words which you may select and then speak to improve the recognition algorithm thereafter. After completing the initial configuration I opened the brief interactive tutorial. It gave examples of typical commands but seemed rather sparse. I would have much preferred a more extensive and guided introductory tutorial.

After the tutorial, I opened a Word document and experimented by cruising the commands as described in the learning center (a task bar which appears on the right hand side of the screen). It quickly became obvious that pace-of-speech was important in eliciting the desired response. You must use a clear and controlled voice. My normal speech pattern (fast and little mumbly) resulted in a high frequency of errors early on. I suspect this may improve as the software learns my quirks of speech.

The learning center is context sensitive to the active application. Navigation, editing and controlling commands are very specific in format and must be followed precisely. Experimenting with the Dragon commands available for each application will seems to be a fine way to learn your way around Dragon. The learning curve seems quite rapid.

The speed of response when dictating is impressive although the software will occasionally lag behind the speaker. Best results are obtained by continuing to speak and trusting the software, as the speech will drop into a queue and appear a few seconds later. It does require some practice to learn to dictate properly.

So far, I've used this with Word, Outlook and Excel. It integrated smoothly with all three and the more I use it, the less I have to correct it.",0
A very good inexpensive 24 port switch. The body of the switch actually takes up the entire width of the rack. This makes for a sturdy installation since the rack ears are very short. The switch is also better looking than the Netgear unit it replaced.,0
"I've used TurboTax for many, many years.  This price was the best I have seen this year.  The DVD arrived quickly and installed perfectly. It downloaded the updates and automatically filled in data from my 2012 filing, which means I have much less to add for this year.",0
"This modem works with Linux, at least the distros that I've been experimenting with (not Ubuntu, which I gave up on a long time ago so I didn't test this modem with Ubuntu, but rather some of the other Linux versions). I haven't tried all the fancy features of the modem (fax, etc) because I don't need that stuff, but dial-up works. I had some problems getting the modem's speaker to be silent, but I think that's probably an issue with my Linux software, and probably not a problem with the modem itself. Given my earlier frustrations with so-called ""WinModems"", I'm just happy to finally have this Zoom modem that actually works.",0
"I had the chance to work with Microsoft Office Home & Student 2010, and it is a robust, productivity suite.  The changes that were introduced in the 2007 version remain and have been improved upon.  This suite has a new ribbon system which allows quicker access, more ability to customize, and increased productivity speed (once you get over the learning curve).  The learning curve took me about two to three weeks to fully figure out where everything I normally use was located.  If you need assistance, click on the HELP button and there is a very easy to use and understand PDF file called ""Migrating to Word 2010 from Word 2003"" which fully explains where things are located and how to do them in Office 2010.  This productivity suite looks great, feels easy to master, has quick access to almost everything in the form of easy-to-recognize icons instead of menus, and will definitely help in speeding through documents.  The introduction of a new FILE menu in 2010 allows quicker access to protecting documents, preparing shared files, managing versions, and viewing properties.  Also the integration of PDF programs such as Adobe Acrobat and Nuance PDF into the Office suite also help speed through documents.  I am using a 32-bit version of Office 2010 on a Windows 7 64-bit OS, and it works perfectly.  Microsoft Office 2010 is a robust office productivity suite and provides quick access to features so you can speed up productivity.  Highly recommended for users of Office 2003 and previous versions.  Users of Office 2007 will need to check the document on the Microsoft site which showcases the upgrades between 2007 and 2010.  My Rating: 5 out of 5.

MORE INFORMATION:
Once you start the install, you need to enter the product key.  You have the option to install a Trial version of Office Professional (which includes Trial versions of Access, Outlook, and
Publisher).  If you remove the check from the checkbox, it will only install the full versions of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote, Visio Viewer, OfficeSharedFeatures, and OfficeTools.  The required space for installation is 1.63GB. I did not check the required space including the Professional Trial versions.  I am runnning Win 7, 64-bit on my PC, and even though this Office 2010 is a 32-bit version, it still works flawlessly.  The file installation took about 7 to 10 minutes.  It was very quick and did not ask questions during the file install process.  When the installation completes, it asks to ""Complete your Office experience online"" with the benefits of : Storing and sharing your documents online and Getting free product updates, help, and training.

From Start menu these programs are visible: Excel, OneNote, Powerpoint, Word, and OfficeTools.  OffceTools include Digital Certificate for VBA Projects, Clip Organizer, Langauge Preferences, Upload Center, Picture Manager (a very convenient and easy to use picture viewer which is one of my favorites), and a link for Office Anytime Upgrade.

If you are new to Office 2010 (and have not used Office 2007) you will  notice the new design.  All the menus are available in ribbons now, and have been reorganized.  The ribbon system was first introduced with Office 2007.  When I upgraded from Office 2003 to Office 2007, it took me a few weeks to figure out where everything was.  But now that I have been using the updated Office, I am happier with this ribbon replacement since it provides quicker access to features.  Rather than clicking on menus and their submenus, most items appear on the ribbon in the form of icons, and the icons are either fully recognizable or mostly recognizable.  All the hot-keys still work for keyboard users so it should not pose a problem for them at all.  For the first three weeks after upgrading, my work slowed down because of having to locate items , but now that I've been using it for nearly a year, Office 2010 is excellent and I can move through projects quicker.

Office 2010 also offers a customizable quick-access bar at the top where you can place icons of features so you can access them with a single click. Personally, I placed my macro recorder and macro list in the quick access bar even though it only takes two clicks to get there normally through the ribbon bar.  If you use any PDF creator programs such as Adobe Acrobat or Nuance PDF, those programs integrate themselves into Office and provide a quick access menu to create PDFs, email PDFs, and create PDF links.

The FILE menu is all new in 2010, which provides access to the usual file options, Permissions and protecting documents, preparation for sharing files, and managing versions. It also lists the Properties of the document (similar to right-clicking the file and choosing properties).  The other menus remain the same as 2007 with better graphics and icon detail.  I use WORD, EXCEL, and POWERPOINT at work and home, and the move to 2007 and 2010 took a short time getting used to but it was very beneficial.

I don't use the OneNote program at all, but the OneNote program allows you to access your file from any computer or web browser and share it with other users by Syncing it to the Web. Or you can just keep it on your own computer.  OneNote organizes things into a single ""notebook"" and lets you get quick access to different types of files that are all related to the same topic/project.  Read more about it at the Microsoft Office site.  OneNote is not a program I use, but it looks like something that I will be using more now that I know of its capabilities.

I am running the 32-bit Office 2010 version on a Win 7 64-bit PC with a triple-core processor and 8GB RAM. Office 2010 runs flawlessly.",0

"WordPerect X5 is an office suite consisting of WordPerfect X5 (Word Processor), Quattro Pro X5 (Spreadsheet), Presentations X5 (Mutimedia Presentation), and WordPerfect Lightning  (Digital Notebook).

This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.

WordPerfect
-----------
- QuickCorrect
QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.

- Multiple File Formats Supported
You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.

- Frustration-Free
I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.

Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.

Quattro Pro
-----------
Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.

Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.

Presentations X5
----------------
Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.

Extras
------
- Create PDF's
New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.

You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.

---
WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite. The bottom line: if you need a word processing program and have only rudimentary spreadsheet needs, the WordPerfect Office X5 suite is definitely the way to go.",0

Great find.  Seller stellar.  Need more.,0
"Look, I could write a review that tries to coddle those who are having a problem with this McAfee Virus Scan program, but for me, it is like finally arriving after a sea of disappointments. (I am talking about McAfee VirusScan Plus 2008-3 User Newest Version) Make sure you remove all other antivirus programs, and firewalls first before loading this McAfee Virus application. I have never seen an antivirus program that works properly with a 2nd antivirus program loaded at the same time.
It includes a Security Center, Virus Scan, Personal Firewall, Easy Network, and Site Advisor.

First of all forgive me for writing such a long review, but there is a lot of ground to cover. For those who like the short version, with less information here it is: Norton slowed my DSL connection down by a third. I spent a day with Verizon, couldn't figure out why all of my other machines in the network were getting 756k, and this one got only 4 or 500 tops. Then I removed Norton, and bingo, instant 756k. AVG free edition is nice but takes a lot of boot up time while it updates upon every single boot up, unless you disable that feature, then it sends out your Outlook email with a message that your antivirus is out of date, and this email could be dangerous, or something like that. Zone Alarm used to be the best, now they are nearing the worst. My Windows 2000 machine went blue screen after an update, took me 2 days to figure out that was the problem, so I removed it after discovering the problem in a forum, and it solved it. Also ZA after recommending it to my friend, would not work at all in a Windows XP Media Center machine. Ask ZA and they say they no longer support it in Media Center. 50 bucks down the drain. Now it takes my XP regular edition SP2 well over 5 minutes to boot with Zone Alarm Security Suite, and I mean WELL over 5 minutes; it's ridiculous. I removed it to load this McAfee Virus Scan (MVS), and the machine immediately booted in only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to the point I was able to bring a Google page up. So I loaded this MVS and the machine booted in only 2 minutes and 45 seconds, once again to a Google page appearing. In both cases I clicked on a Google desktop icon as soon as it appeared, and then waited for the results. It clicks, goes dark blue, and waits for everything else to load, including MVS before it will allow a page to appear. So MVS took only 30 additional seconds to load, and according to Scotty the watchdog in WinPatrol, it loads about 7 .exe files. So that is fast. Now that is with a machine that is loaded up with a ton of programs.

I first loaded MVS in my home office machine, in the same network, with the same configuration, Asus A8N SLI, AMD 64 3200+, 1Gb ram. The home office machine with MVS loaded, gave me the same results but in approximately one minute before I could get a Google page up. (This is an edit, I actually timed the boot up, and not counting the time to type in my password, it booted in exactly 42 seconds) Boot up to Google in only a minute with MVS, and in 2 minutes and 45 seconds in my overloaded machine that used to take well over 5 minutes with Zone Alarm. I'm sold.

While performing a scan it did not affect the performance of the machine, either in surfing the web, or opening programs, even the intensive programs like Dreamweaver MX 2004, or Photoshop CS2.

When loading do as the quick start guide says, put in the CD, then choose the option of loading from the web. It's a 45 Meg download, but it's the latest.

Manage network feature, it recognized all of the other machines, and components with an IP address in my network. It recognized my Windows Server 2003 R2 Edition, but gave me a status message of a request to upgrade to an operating system of at least W2000 or later. I guess that is because of W2003 security, blocking scans.

Before I even acquired MVS I did not understand exactly what they meant by the 3 user allowance, and couldn't find anything on it, so I want to share that with you. Did they mean that you could load it on one machine sharing a network, and then scan individual drives across the network, the same way early ZA did, or does this mean you can put it in more than one machine for full protection at all times. Fortunately it means the latter. I loaded it in the home office machine, registering it in my name to be able to get virus updates, and created a user name and password. Then I went into the other machine, dropped in the CD, did a complete install, but when the registration page came up, I logged in instead, and it instantly completed the registration for me, reminding me of my user name and password, and congratulating me on the installation. So it is a 3 machine complete install, that is cool, or should I say way cool.

I know this isn't about MVS but I advise you to get a free copy of CCleaner from the web. (Google it.) It cleans all the junk out of your computer and you can run it quickly before entering sensitive password sites for example. It cleans out your cache, cookies, etc. in only a few seconds. When you run it for the first time, it will take several minutes to remove it all, for example a ton of web pages you have been surfing, that your machine checks first, before drawing it from the distant server. A slooooow way for your machine to have to work.

McAfee has been around for a zillion years, they have been a leader, and from the performance of this product so far, they have totally aced it. You can see all of the other antivirus and firewall programs I have tried, and this one according to boot up time, and scan speed is the best. It scanned my office machine quickly, although I did not time it accurately. It scanned several gigs of data in what seemed like 10 minutes. My other machine with 230 Gigs of data takes about 5 hours with Zone Alarm, because I am using their older 7.0 version, it took 3 times that long with their newer version that works with Vista and XP. I am using it on an XP machine. Once again, had to get rid of the update, and go back to an earlier version.

Look I can't speak for everyone, or everyone's machine, but all I know is I am totally impressed with this McAfee product, and hope and pray they don't go down the tubes like Norton, and Zone Alarm did. (I have not used any recent Norton products, but Norton was the best when Peter Norton was there solving the DOS problems, almost like a miracle man, then from about 10 years ago, everything of theirs I tried was junk.) Sorry for the pointed remarks, but sometimes you find a product, after spending years in frustration, or at least you find something that works, then it goes bad, and finally, finally, something that really works great like this MVS. For me, my hat is off to McAfee. 150 Stars and counting. Highly recommended to say the least.
PS: I noticed another reviewer was having problems logging onto online acounts, so I put it to the test, logged into my bank account, which is a 3 step process, and also my online server, and did not have any problems. If I have any, or notice anything after using this product more, I will come back and edit the review. All of the essentials place this one at the top for now.",0

"The Good:

*Sea of features you'd expect from Corel
*Supports art pens, tablets and other peripherals
*Great User Interface

The Bad:

*Intimidating for newbies

The Bottom Line:

A great program that you'd expect from Corel.  I wanted an upgrade for Windows Paint and boy was I wrong!  This program is way way waaaaay more than just a simple paint program.  It actually scared me off with when it listed terms like ""color theory.""  An instruction booklet contains over 90 pages and it actually offers customer support for those who are stuck.  This is an advanced program and using a program like this to draw a 3D cube would be like having Pavarotti to sing at an empty warehouse.  I took a challenge of learning it and actually produced some of my best digital artworks.  Therefore to simply put:  If you need a simple upgrade to Windows Paint, this may not be for you.  However, professionals out there will apprecaite this program greatly.",0
These dopes think I'm going to write something here. Nuts to them.,0
"Wow, I thought that I'd already done a review on this product.  Will do one, now!  Norton SW has saved my machines, almost daily, certainly at least once a month, for years.  I just bought three more of these NSW 2006, as I couldn't find them before (now have 9 sets, and I think each license is good for up to 3 machines).  You can use the program from the CD, don't have to install it.  So test usage on your machine via the CD, first.

I love this program suite.  Been using this since my first Windows PC which someone had thrown into the trash, in the year 2000.  It was due to NSW 2000 that I was able to resurrect that PC's registry.  It was a Win95 machine which the owner (who didn't know how to wipe his hard drive) was trying to convert to Win98.  He couldn't do it, so trashed the machine.  A janitor named Jesus who knew me, decided he wanted to save the trashed machine for me.  Two weeks later, on my pastor's birthday or at least the first week of it (1st April), he found me and gave me that Micron machine.  So I've been using this program since 2000.

So obviously when NSW 2006 came along, me and my newly-purchased XP were glad to get it.  With this, you can rescue your machine from updates, from installations, from anything that goes on, using GoBack (I had GoBack already from Wildfile, but Norton purchased it.)  Atop that, are the myriad of utilities which Norton was long famous for in DOS and earlier Windows.  Plus, many utilities in the 'Optimizer' and 'Check It Diagnostics' that make Windows much easier to use.

Then there's One Button Checkup.  For Win98 machines, it's a godsend.  You can do just about anything to edit or fix your registry, because 'one button' only means AUTOMATING the process, versus the rest of the utilities, which can be manually or interactively run.  Seriously, if you still use Win98 you need this program.  Two big categories of registry fixes are for drive letters or folder location changes (i.e., if you move a program from one location to another), and for entries referring to uninstalled programs which you didn't install using Norton Clean Sweep.  The more such entries clog your registry, the slower Windows is to boot, and eventually it can't boot.  So cleaning the registry is vital.  But for most people, cleaning it seems daunting, and yes can be dangerous.  That's why this program is such a godsend.  I didn't even know anything about Windows when I got that trashed machine.  But thanks to Norton, I could learn quickly, and got it up and running.

Now for XP, this wonderful program which resurrected my Windows machine from Jesus in second review paragraph -- the XP version, is not as flexible and helpful.  But it's not bad.  It finds and fixes bad registry entries usually left behind due to program or Windows updates.  I still run it weekly on my XP machines (I now have five).  You always have 'undo', so if you changed something, you can undo the change and restore the machine as if your 'fix' never occurred.  It can no longer properly edit the registry.  But for that, you can get TuneUp Utilities 2011 and later, which has the same functions as Norton here, and many more.  (TuneUp doesn't have GoBack or virus programs, however.)

There have always been complaints about NSW since Symantec took them over.  I echo those complaints.  But the solution, is to never install the virus protection, and to turn off Live Update (which you are forced to install).  I learned to do that, early on.

Don't let the partially-bad stuff reported (generally correctly) keep you from buying this, if you are still on XP.  GoBack alone is worth several days' angst each time Windows update or some program update, crashes your machine.  Many people swear by it, so just look for the reviews, or Google on 'GoBack', see what folks are saying.  For me, it's a must-have.  It doesn't work with EASEUS or Acronis or Rebit, but DOES work with Macrium Reflect 5 Pro.

Seriously: I've used this program daily for 13 years.  GoBack in particular has saved Windows crashes so often, I've lost count.  You can turn it off and on, and yes when you do that there's a long wait, because GoBack deletes all its continuous snapshots it takes of your machine's operation.  But honey, when you have a crash, and GoBack boots pre Windows, it's the sweetest thing to literally TURN THE CLOCK BACK to the time when your machine was working.  In addition, you get to see all of what happened just prior to the crash, so you can tell WHY something went wrong.  (That's how you even know when to turn the clock back, GoBack keeps a continual log of computer operations.)

If by contrast you're on Windows 7 and want to know what is the next-best-thing, try TuneUp Utilities.  I reviewed TuneUp 2011 here in Amazon a year ago, and with it 2012 and 2013.  TuneUp does all the good stuff of Norton, except it has no GoBack (but MagiCure does, operating a bit differently, so too Macrium Reflect 5 Pro).  TuneUp has no anti-virus programs or utilities, so you don't have to worry about that. :)

I realize this review needs to be more specific about what these utilities are: but there are too many to list. Just put your questions as comments to this review.  Amazon emails me per comment, so I'll know, and come answer you.

Essentially, your PC needs a lot of housekeeping, and you probably dislike at least a few of Windows' defaults.  So unless you're willing to learn 'GodMode' in Windows (a secret Windows folder you create to access a table of contents for tweaking EVERYTHING in Windows, Google on the term), get this: and this, is safer.",0
Far as I can tell the unit works just fine.  I have it connecting my home office and residential network and works as intended.  Didn't want to spend the money for the managed switch as I don't need it yet so for the price it works great.,0

"We have several relatives that live quite far away and don't have access to the internet. For years now I've been creative DVDs of pictures and movies for them to watch on their DVD players which has worked out well, but is often a time-consuming process on my end. A few years ago I started using PowerDirector and I was impressed. Year after year PowerDirector has been improved to the point where creating DVDs is a quick and almost enjoyable process.

I've used more expensive programs in the past, particularly Adobe Premiere... PowerDirector isn't quite as accurate and is missing a few features, however it's faster and easier to put together videos. I'm not looking to edit a blockbuster movie and what PowerDirector offers is perfect. My DVDs are usually just a picture slideshow with brief sections of videos in between. It's a simple drag and drop to add the pictures and videos and from there videos can be edited and effects can be added.

For the price, I can't find anything better.",0
"I have owned the NV+ and this NVX is much better, read much faster.  It validated all the new disks I bought and said two of them were bad even though they worked in a PC.

"OK, first off I need to admit that I am a native New Mexican and have been around Spanish speaking folks most of my life. That probably gives me a bit of an advantage in attempting to learn the language. Another advantage is Rosetta Stone's Version 3 language system. The installation was simple and the program works great. You learn Spanish the same way you learned English: you learn to say what you see. It's fun and kind of addicting. And best of all, you can start speaking the language right away and little by little gain a confident and comprehensive grasp of Spanish. Highly recommended! Enjoy!!",0
"I bought two copies of the Win8 Pro upgrade, one for myself and one for my elderly mother.  In my case, the upgrade program found one incompatible application on my Windows 7 computer; once that's removed (the upgrade program does it for you when you tell it to go ahead and remove the application), everything went smoothly and it took less than 20 minutes to upgrade.  Then my mother upgraded her Win7 machine, too, and reported no problems.  Microsoft really did an excellent job this time with the upgrade path.",0

Home Designer Support

If you're playing around with the idea of designing your own home, or doing some updates to your existing home, this is a great tool.  You have several features that make it easy to plan and then visualize your home as you have designed it.  The 3-D views are impressive, and really give a sense of what you're designing.

It's important to have an up-to-date computer for this program because it requires fast video, plenty of memory (both RAM and hard-drive) and a large monitor makes working a lot more productive and pleasant.

If you've used similar products, you will find this familiar and easy to use.  First time users should have a basic understanding of home design, and the ability to use fairly standard computer drawing tools.  But whatever your skill level, this product is a blast and can easily become addictive.  I spent a day measuring all the rooms in my home and then rendering it with this program.  Then over a few years, executing the plans we made, knowing with pretty good confidence, what the finished product would look like!",0

"I am very pleased that LeapFrog seems to be developing more LeapPad games for the 3 to 5 age group.  My daughter is 3 1/2 years old, and some of the games recommended for 4 and 5 year olds can be too challenging and frustrating for her.

The main focus of this game is how things work.  I really like that this is a science based game, since most seem to be based on math, reading, and writing.  Like many kids her age, my daughter loves Sesame Street.  She was very excited to get a new game with some of her favorite characters.  I played this with her the first time, after which she felt confident enough to play it by herself.  I'm not a big fan of electronics for kids, but LeapFrog really makes great educational games.  I don't feel guilty letting my daughter spend 30 minutes with her LeapPad Ultra while I'm busy making dinner after getting home from work.",0
"The definitive software suite.  I use about 1% of the capabilities, but those I use are excellent.  The value is very high since the cost is spread across the users in my family.

We also can add text such as titles and textual information in the video.

"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.",0

"Cyberlink PowerDVD 15 Ultra is a great video playback product.  The installation is rather straightforward but you will need to connect your laptop or PC to the internet to activate the license key.  After installation, all compatible video formats and DVD or Blu-Ray discs will be automatically opened in this software.  You can configure options like color, sound and 3D visual effects to dramatically improve the visual experience.  I use a Sony VAIO Intel i7 laptop with an NVIDIA mobile graphics card through an HDMI cable connected to a Samsung 63 plasma television to watch my movies.  You will discover early on that this software effectively uses your streaming cores to enhance playback.

I have used the PowerDVD product line for over 5 years now and feel that Cyberlink PowerDVD 15 Ultra is the best one yet.  The playback of Blu-Ray movies is now flawless on my Samsung 63 television over HDMI and the program interface is much improved.  You should consider this product first before any others if you want it to playback movies on your laptop or home computer.",0
"Like many other PC geeks, I looked at Windows XP and its eye-candy UI with suspicion when it first came out, but I've come to love it.  It's rock solid -- I've never had a single system crash in the last two years, even though as a gadget freak I install and try out new hardware a lot -- it's fast, and its plug-n-play feature is so much better than any other operating system.  Service Pack 2 makes XP even better, esp. in the security arena.  It now comes with a better firewall and turns off some default settings that used to be on which could invite security problems.  (The flip side of this increased security meausre is you constantly get warnings.)

XP Home is great for home use.  If you want file system-level encryption, true file permission settings and more networking options, opt for the Professional edition.

I highly recommend teh book ""Windows XP Inside Out, 2nd edition"" if you are interested in optimzing your XP system and/or learning advanced techniques.",0

"In the beginning there were not many choices in computer virus protection, but that changed throughout the years and the market is now flooded to the point where the general consumer does not know what to purchase.

Enter McAfee -- one of the first virus protections on the market and arguably still the best.

To test out McAfee Internet Security 2009. I knowingly infected a test machine with a minor trojan virus. I then went ahead and and installed a free virus cleaner that did not detect it. I then went ahead and installed McAfee which picked it up right away and cleaned it up.

McAfee has been a name synonymous with quality for quite some time now, and in 2009 it does it again. CPU and processor speed does not spike as with some virus software and you will know your computer is safe ans sound.",0

"Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium version 13 is extremely similar to version 12 but has a lot of added extras, most of those are about the integration with Windows and the social media barrage of utilities.

 On a fresh install, you should be aware that you need.net 4.5 framework for Dragon NaturallySpeaking. After.net InstallShield has finished then the somewhat lengthy process of installing version 13 will occur (in my case, I put it on a laptop with a fairly high chipset, 12 gig of RAM, a secondary SSD drive and a moderately decent motherboard). It still took 90 minutes to complete. Anyway, in the early stages when the license agreement pops up you should read this, since some people may want to return the software.

  You will then be asked for the license key, and my suggestion is for you to choose custom set up. Custom set up gives you multiple options in English, and with most people, if they don't have a lexicon from the US, UK and other places, they will be perpetually corrected by the system. During the lengthy install, and it seems that it is long because the install process works out what the audio has for recording and playback, you will be constantly shown the basic tips and the learning center: from the point of view of someone new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking these two areas plus the quick start guide are the core points for using Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

If you have a version of Dragon, and have spent some time developing your profile, you should have it backed up. If not, you should do it as soon as possible. The handy part is that if you use version 12 and 13 like I do, you can use your profile and have it learning from where you were.
I use Dragon 12 at work and at home, so I have some level of comparison wih the versions in a personal and networked environment. You can't skimp on the system configuration, and if it looks like you might have to, then don't bother using Dragon. Dragon can control some windows functions, but thats not its prime purpose. Where I find it excels is when you have injuries, and I do, Dragon is a great tool. However, keeping your hard drive defragmented and optimized is essential. You can use Norton utils, or if you have issues ( technical issues) get a usb drive  of 8 to 16 gig, and install utils from portable apps dot com; portable apps defrag and optimize tools can basically save your setup, and it helps Dragon function. The biggest contrast I have is that my copy of Dragon at work uses a hard-drive that cannot be defragged because of the network, and the memory is garbage ( 2 gigs for Windows 7 is insane). Dragon is not as bad as some have said in performance, the reason that word shuts down on some computers with Dragon is that the PC has not been defragged and optimized ( by optimized I meand chkdsk with an F switch and other things; in most cases just run the app and click ""opimize"" from portable apps, it does work).

 The quick start guide is basically the main guide that you will initially be referring to, and for the most part it is unchanged from version 12. The elements you need to consider are what headsets you are going to use and in my opinion not use the one that comes with Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I chose KOSS CS-100 because of its noise reduction capabilities; if you don't have a headset with noise reduction capabilities the cyclical feedback will be a constant headache. Also, I would strongly suggest you do not use a broadband Bluetooth headset: this is not just a security suggestion, it is because the amount of people I know who have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and tried the Bluetooth headset, and they just gave up is very high.

This next suggestion is basically more than a suggestion: you will need to keep your hard drive as defragmented as you possibly can, and optimize the functions on Windows as best you can. If you use Dragon NaturallySpeaking on a network device, I know from experience that unless you have a group policy that frees up certain capabilities on your PC, you will have a very hard time using Dragon. The sum total of what happens on a PC is that the profile you use has to be as defragmented as possible, otherwise it will be shutting down about 50 to 60% of the time. The one thing I can say from experience is that when I first got Dragon, I had one arm that I could not use. The big problem is that you will need to use certain keyboard commands, so if you are using or planning to use Dragon with the hope of not doing any keyboard commands at all, then you may need to rethink your plans. You can macro certain things, but until Dragon gets used to your voice, and you get used to Dragon which in my experience can be from four weeks to three months, there is a learning curve.

It is an excellent tool, but the vowel sounds will catch you most of the time and certain conjunct consonants windup delivering some of the most absurd renderings of your speech: but the silly part about it is if you highlight the word or phrase that has come up looking absurd, the version you want is usually in the selection available. In my opinion is a handy tool, but it has its limitations.
  These are the quirks of the system, but once you get to know the short guide, it will allow you to use Dragon easily and quickly. Expect to do some editing; at least part of your verbal commands will be for editing, so you need to know that in advance.

  The claim is one of 99% accuracy but if you expect 93% as your peak, then you won't feel let down when you have to go through and do copious editing. It is very good and Dragon have a tool that is getting better and better since I first saw it around 2000, and the integration with Windows and various applications are getting better and better. Overall if you do want a version of Dragon that operates better, check out the one for Mac, which in my opinion is a lot better, but still this version for PC is still very good.",0

"The installation of this program went smooth with no problems whatsoever (Windows XP with Service Pack 2).

While this is basically a scaled down version of Corel's professional product, ParitnerX, it still has a tremendous number of options and abilities that are more than enough to meet the needs of the home or hobby user.  With two workspaces You can choose to create a picture or illustration from scratch or apply various effects to your photographs to give it an artistic effect.

I did find that the interface was confusing until I actually bothered to read the manual. Afterward it was very easy to use and in fact seemed intuitive, guess I just needed a jump start to understand what it was supposed to be doing.  With options for detail level adjustments, brush types, brush sizes, opacity, paper type and many, many other choices you can pretty much create any effect you want.

The Drawing & Painting workspace is fairly easy to use but seems to be yet another drawing and painting program with nothing in particular to recommend or detract from other products.  Much more than Paint, much less than Illustrator it strikes a good solid middle ground.  However, when it comes to the Photo Painting area this is an amazing product. Want to take a picture and make it look like an oil painting?  No problem.  What about a watercolor?  No problem.  Charcoal, chalk, sketch.... no problem.  It did an amazing job and I was really pleased with the results after working with it a while and getting to understand the program.  I did notice that photos with a lot of color and contrast variation turn out much nicer than those that are predominantly dark or composed of a predominantly small range of color.

The program is well worth the price for the photo painter ability by itself.  The results are really amazing and I was very please with the results.",0

"I found Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 relatively easy to learn and use, and I had no issues with installation either. My last version of this software was version X3, and I certainly did find this version to be quite a bit faster, and the user interface to be quite a bit better. This latest version boasts several performance improvements over previous versions, and it also has an even longer list of editing tools. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is an efficient and comprehensive video editing program that has more than enough features and video editing capabilities for the average user.

One reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. But the main reason I got this new version is for the 64-bit high-end Special FX Pack, the really great slideshow maker, and the much faster video rendering. This software is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the muscle department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

Something else I wanted to mention is that I own several other video editing programs, and while their specs are the same as Corel's, for some reason Corel's rendered output just plain looks better. I don't know why, but it does. And not just a little bit better either. It's significantly better. After you finish your project, what you see onscreen is significantly clearer and smoother. This, of course, isn't a minor thing, this is a major thing, and this tells me that Corel's software is definitely doing something differently, something much better than what their competitor's software is doing. So, while there are other video editing programs that certainly have more bells and whistles than Corel's, if the quality of the finished product is the most important thing to you, do take Corel's top quality output into account.

Now, like I said, my last version of the software was version X3, and while all the improvements to this latest version are really terrific, what makes this newest version a real winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly. I hope you found this review helpful.",0

"A very good GPS system that has robust tracking data and a very good interface. The ability to see driving for the past day combined with the ability to download data is great. It also has some nice features like replay and the a quasi scoring system for your drivers. It can set up alerts and other cool things to alert your fleet manager or a parent if certain events happen or thresholds are broken.

The downside to this unit is the 20 bucks a month subscription, This is pretty affordable, but I have also seen full featured sets like Zubie that are much cheaper.

The other downside is the pretty bright lights on the front of the OBD unit. At night, it can light up and constantly blink becoming a distraction and an annoyance. I had to put a piece of back tape over the front. Just FYI.

Otherwise, it is a very nice system that is very full featured, has great tracking results and great tools. it just might be a little more expensive than other trackers. So compare the features carefully for what you will need and not need. Oh yeah and those darn lights ....",0

All-in-All a very good product.",0
"I have always used symantec's norton 360, but when I got a new Dell computer it had McAfee on it, and from there on I'll never use anything else.  McAfee IE Security has some absolutely great extra porgrams that do more than Norton 360 ever did, and McAfee is actually does do automatic updates that norton never did. I going to get McAfee Total Protection next time. I have never been so satisfied with any antivirus product, and this does so much more. I don't generally write great reviews, but this the only product that allows me to control, and has never stopped on me. I am amazed!!!",0
"A great little hub for those of us still wired to each other, very fast, no set up issues, just plug it in and it works, with auto speed sensing and nice activity display lights. Perfect for a wired home or small office network.",0

"This is a small game only in cost: it has offered me endless hours of fun!
If I were to describe this game as simply ""building bridges made out of, well, elastic goo"", I would do it no justice. I could never imagine how entertaining balancing goo-tension and gravity could be!

The graphics are clear and do not have high hardware requirements. The music is well chosen and appropriate. And the gameplay you will find yourself longing for after some hours away from the game.

WORLD OF GOO is a game that can be enjoyed by the whole family - and it comes free from any draconian DRM schemes.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0
"I have used this program for a number of years with great results and many complements for the cards etc. I create with it.  I recently upgraded my computer to a new one which used Vista, of course. I bought this latest version to insure compatability with the Vista operating system.  You can really be creative with this program, yet have a neat card ready in a short time.  This is one of my most used programs on my computer.",0
"The only issue I have with this product is the price, but note that the price includes one year of free cloud storage.  WIth that, I'm not sure what happens after the year if you didn't have the items stored locally.  Still, the best thing for me with this product is that it will stream through Apple TV and Chromecast, thus allowing me to keep my rather bulky laptop in the my home office and not bring it in the living room with an hdmi cable.  Beyond that, and that's a big thing because I don't have a DVD player anymore (or Blu Ray, which this also covers), I'm not sure of the super value of this software.  So, it's loaded with features and all cool things, but just things (like superior sound) that just aren't super important to me.  Movies I get are usually comedies and don't need theater sound.  But, overall it's a very handy utility, with streaming and use with my iPhone, so I think the program does everything you'd want with something like this.  I wish it were cheaper, or, maybe there will be a 17th version at some point, dropping the price of this.  It still will be an amazing program.",0
"After doing a clean installation, I found that was no longer there. I was unable to buy it at Apple. That's being there in a pinch.",0
"Tiger, OS X 10.4 is another leap forward in the O.S. arena and Apple, once again leads the way. (Features will surely be copied by that ""other"" OS vendor.)
IF you have a G4 or G5 Mac, Tiger is a definite. For compatible G3 systems, you may not find Tiger worthwhile.
New features and stability are once again the hallmarks of this Apple software gem.
Spotlight: A remarkably speedy context search tool. The little magnifying-glass icon at the top right of the menu bar brings up Spotlight quick search. Enter a word or phrase and instantly (once the index is built) files matching by name or content will be shown to you. When you first run your Mac using Tiger, it will automatically build a Spotlight index, which can take a few hours, depending on the number and size of the files on your disk(s). The speed at which Spotlight can find files is astounding. Even if you search for a word buried in an obscure location, Spotlight can find it.
Dashboard Widgets: These are mini-applications. Icons ""float"" above your desktop and are easily accessible. Such items as a desk clock, calendar, weather monitor and iTunes player are readily usable and hundreds more can be downloaded, both from Apple and third-parties.
RSS in Safari: Now Safari is RSS capable. You can ""subscribe"" to RSS feeds to get updates throughout the day from RSS providers. News services, weather and bargain web pages are just a few examples of providers. If an RSS feed is available, Safari will recognize this and place an RSS icon in the address bar, so you can click on it to easily access the RSS information from that site.
Tiger runs smoothly. You really need at least 512 MB of memory - a gig or more would be preferable. Once you get past the initial index creation by Spotlight, Tiger feels fast.
If you are upgrading, check with the vendors of the programs and peripherals (printers, scanners, etc.) you use to make sure these are ready for OS X 10.4. Many of the reported problems are caused by incompatibility.
If you are currently running Panther (OS X 10.3) and are undecided about upgrading, you should consider the feature list. There is no dramatic speed increase (other than Spotlight vs. Finder.) The latest update (10.4.2, as of this writing) is very stable. If you want the features, go for it, it is worthwhile. If not, you can probably hold off until OS X 10.5.
If you are running anything prior to OS X 10.3, this is the time to upgrade. You will notice the speed boost. Stability and feature richness are very apparent.",0

"My teacher who is certified Comp TIA A+,Network+, etc told me about Norton ghost and I don't get why there are so many bad reviews on this.

I've tried other apps, but they always seem to fall short of Office and therefore I've actually purchased two of these!  That Outlook is not included is insignificant to me as I rarely use Outlook.

This one is as reliable as the sunrise and pretty inexpensive, making it a pretty good buy. At the moment I have my desktop, printer/fax/copier/scanner, laptop and one Panasonic network security camera connected to this router, all wireless, and they all work very reliably. Not a high-end router, but very reliable. Kinda like a VW Bug, not real sexy, but does what it was intended to do.",0

"Overall this is a similar package to the Paintshop Pro Ultimate but with less included items.  Less costly and so more inviting for those who are on a tight budget.

I've been using IRfanview for a long time to do my basic photo editing.  However, once I stepped up to a DSLR camera, I wanted something much more powerful to do the job.  A long while back I had use photoshop and was quite proficient.  But I remember a very steep learning curve and a software package that was expensive.  This Paintshop program really cleans up photos that I take to a higher level and it's really easy to learn how to do all the functions.  Runs well and does not crash.  Highly recommend it for the price in consideration.",0
"Corel continues to be the best budget software choice for video, audio and photo editing. The controls are intuitive and online support is great. Corel is a well-established company that has worked on finely honing its products over the years. I own several different Corel packages and they have all been great. if you can't afford Adobe but want something better than freeware then I highly recommend this product.",0
"For those who very occasionally run across a zip file and need to open it, WinZip 14 likely isn't worthwhile.  Ever since Windows XP, after all, Microsoft has included a built in zip manager.  The trouble is that while this basic zip management exists, it really is not all that good.  It opens and it makes zip files.

For those who deal with lots of files and find that compressing and combining files into zip folders is a regular task, I heartily recommend WinZip 14.  It is very easy to use, and provides significantly more compression than other programs I have used. It also offers much better security options, and overall has made my file management tasks and emailing significantly easier.

This is a program that works, works easily, and works better than anything else I have found.  Definitely worth the small amount of money.",0
"According to AV-Test and other reviews I've read, Kapersky has a 100% detection rate. some people prefer whole PC security suites that include, in addition to anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-phishing, identity protection, etc. The professional IT community generally discourages the use of such products. The simple reason is they often cause problems, particularly performance related problems, and as a result wind up being disabled altogether. The fact is it is very difficult to make a comprehensive security suite that functions on as many as 21 different versions of XP, Vista, and Windows 7, with differing levels of service packs, and any number of potentially conflicting installed software that comes with or is preinstalled by browsers, ISPs, OEMs, etc. By using a standalone product you can exercise total control over what's being controlled and easily identify any problems or conflicts. Moreover, I question the utility of some of the extraneous features of the whole security suites like identity protection. Or to put it another way, if you're going to buy one security product, make it an anti-virus product. Also the line between anti-virus and malware is pretty blurry but rest easy as Kapersky detects malware as well. I also like the security gadget, a slick little desktop gadget that provides realtime notification of your systems status.",0
"In my humble opinion this is probably the best Nancy Drew game of the series.  This game finds Nancy in a creepy mansion in England attempting to find out why an old friend appears to be under a curse.  Her adventures take her all over the mansion, which is clearly hiding some secrets.  The mansion is delightfully spooky, and there are plenty of spooky happenings to add to the atmosphere.  This game has some of the most challenging puzzles of all the Nancy Drew games.  It's also quite long.  All in all, good fun, and good value for money.",0

"I just upgraded to Security pro and though it promises a lot more protection than the earlier version, I have not noticed any perceivable slowing of my system or any other issues. I was also able to easily remove the earlier version, something I have had problems with in the past when I used Norton.

I have had it on my system for a month now and can say it runs seemlessly in the background which is where I like my virus protection to stay. A second system clearning/detection program I run periodically has not found any adware or other problems that it has missed. The only conflict I ran into was having to remove Spybot, but it informed me that it needed to be removed so I didn't have to hunt down the conflict later.",0
This is one of my favorite AV programs. I like they way it operates and TM even has customer support that one can talk to for free. I an not sure of the program being on a USB for install. I could not see any advantage.,0
"I have used both Painter 11 and Painter 12 and find these more intuitive to use than Painter Essentials 5, which is essentially a stripped-down version of the full-fledged Painter programs. Painter 11 and 12 have more brushes, more canvas textures, wet background painting, more options and customizations, and a slew of other niceties that Painter Essentials lack. HOWEVER, Painter is also more than 10 times the price of Painter Essentials. PLUS, Painter 11 and 12 are buggy and computer resource intensive. Painter Essentials, on the other hand, is easy on the CPU, has a much smaller memory footprint, is less buggy, and plays very well with Windows 10.

If you're not a graphic artist and simply want to try your hand at digital painting or to use the (very nifty) auto-painting feature, which transforms your photos into very convincing works of art, Painter Essentials is a good way to go. If you can't decide which program is right for you, Corel offers free trials of both programs (direct links provided in the comments section).

I personally like Painter Essentials 5 and think it is very good for what it is. Definitely recommended for the semi-serious digital artist.",0

"I've used Norton before and various free anti-virus, and with a professional version you get a more comprehensive set of security options that quietly takes care of business in the back ground.  There is a peace of mind factor that a professional version gives you, and for the less than tech savvy it's a bit more idiot proof than a bare bones free ware.  I have no problem with free ware, as my computing needs are pretty simple, but a pro version is very nice and this is pretty cheap for the year long comfort of install it and then pretty much forget about it security.  I got this current product via the Vine, but I have bought the professional 360 Norton for the two years running previously when it has been on sale.  I have multiple computers so the 3 license is handy and I do tend to use all three.  For the most part Norton is comfortable and user friendly especially if you aren't overly expert with using software.",0

"I have the misfortune of owning a laptop that shipped with Windows 8.1.  It isn't as bad as you've probably heard, it's much worse.  The user interface is completely different and much more confusing.  Installing a third party program, Classic Shell, helps get that back to ""normal"".  However it is unstable, buggy, and prone to getting stuck in loops where if it locks up it reboots itself... again and again.  I got stuck in this loop after a driver update but apparently this loop issue has existed since Windows 8 with no fix in sight.  Microsoft managed to mess this up even worse than Vista or ME.  I think I'm finally to the point where I wish I'd bought an Apple.  Avoid Windows, they just can't get it right.",0

"For the second year in a row I'll be using Norton as my multi-device. I'm not sure it is the best currently available, but it sure isn't the hyper invasive program it origins.

lly was. There was a time when Norton was as intrusive and as hard to get rid of as the most intrusive malware. Whatever the reason, the developers have ceased trying to be indispensable by making it impossible to get off of a machine, and instead has become surprisingly noninvasive. It will protect just about any gadget you need protection for, from lap tops to desk tops to tablets to cell phones. And remarkably, no more intrusively than any other other protection software. It works transparently and mainly behind the scenes, unlike the bad-old-Norton. It is always good to see a company that previously got tings so wrong to suddenly get them so right.",0
"I have been using MS Office professional for decades. This latest version simply provides the top version in the most convenient, automatically updated, and economical format. The annual subscription renews the app on all 5 machines for a year, for under $100 ($20 per year per PC or device). I have had a number of scary moments with the Outlook component, but each was quickly fixed by the readily-available Microsoft telephone service for this product (I let them take over my machine and they quickly fix it in less than 10 minutes). Frankly, this telephone service deserves more than five stars--competing at a near-perfect level, despite competing support elsewhere in the software market being scandalously poor.",0

"Ok this is about looking up your family tree, but as an adjunct they train you in utilizing online resources to look people up. How is that old spouse doing? :-) Anyhow this has to be the king of all online ancestry tools. I was surprised to know that my grandmother arrived in this country and when instead of being second generation. I was curious what part of Italy she came from. This and a whole lot more is available online utilizing the built in resources family tree taps into.

The really interesting thing is that since it is so widespread that others even distant relatives who have participated and did the leg work to build the tree can be imported into your own tree. The Platinum version includes a six month membership into Ancestry.com which is no small feat because that is about ninety dollars worth of membership. This deluxe version provides 3 months. Even if you bought family tree maker and used it for 6 months you could find just about all of the information that you would need. With the Platinum version the fact that another disc with the platinum version is included in the box to give to someone else, enables you to partake on the journey with another family member, although a second membership into Ancestry is not included.

In using it I found that just like any other application there is a slight learning curve. They included a thick book with it so this is not something you just sit down and become an expert at in an afternoon. That is a good thing because the deeper you want to get into it, the more complex the program becomes.

I always envied those families that we still all together. They had certain bonds that made it that way. For example even though flaw abound, they stuck together, never back sliding one another. Oh they may discuss particular person's anomalies, but never is a condemning way. My own family became particulated... a fancy word for broken apart. My Mom grew up with relatives galore; by the time I came into the picture it was splintered apart. Who offended who? The interesting thing is that I have a huge family out there. My grandmother's sister had 7 children; most of them live in the area I am sure. The older generation passed away, and maybe the offenses passed with them. I am not disrespecting the older generation, I love them, but I would like to see if this huge family can become a family again. It is a new time, and who hated who is irrelevant.

I have someone I know who has a huge family and once a year they rent out this park where they have an outside picnic, everyone brings a dish. That way you are not inviting all kinds of people into your house, some that are so distant you don't even know who they are. It works, and I would like to try it. Family Tree Maker makes that possible. So if you are just interested in who came before you, and who they married, or gave birth to, or you want to utilize this to re-establish long lost family connections, get Family Tree Maker. It is an exciting journey as you are discovering how it works, and they provide a lot of built in help, and tutorials along the way. Overall highly recommended.",0
"I purchased this full version so I could load it on my Macbook via bootcamp and it worked flawlessly. All of the drivers for my computer peripherals were loaded correctly. The At&T Uverse wireless internet was configured in a snap. Bootcamp is a great utility. I was only able to load 32 bit version because my mac was just on the outside of the requirements for 64 bit. But it still works great!  I really like this version of windows. We use XP at work and it was great for a while especially after win 95 but Win 7 is incredible. We skipped Vista so this upgrade was long overdue. Everything seems to work better. The Adobe CS 5 suite is amazing on Win 7. I wish there were better font management options. All in good time I assume.

*update* 7-23-2012
I have finally upgraded my Mac to lion and Win 7 still runs perfectly on the bootcamp drive. I had waited longer than I usually would to upgrade Mac OS X because I was reading that there was some issues with the bootcamp partition and OS X lion. Well, I had no issues whatsoever. I wish I would have upgraded earlier. This dual boot machine is the best thing that I have ever done. It's like have 2 computers with you at all times! I can't wait to get my hands on Win 8.

"I'm writing this review moments after filing my 2015 federal and state taxes. This is the sixteenth consecutive year I've used TurboTax. In some years, Intuit does better jobs than others, and it has certainly has some stumbles in both usability and technical issues in some of those years. Not so this year.

The user interface is basically the same as the 2014 version; you can step through an ""interview"", or just direct Turbo Tax to display the items you are interested in. Installation and updates were problem free (Windows 10 machine).

I still remember the days when tax returns were a three-day long and migraine-inducing affair. Tax time is stressful enough...this helps take some of the sting away.

My only beef is that Intuit repeatedly tries to upsell extra services throughout the preparation process. Happily, it also makes declining these offers easy enough.

Great tax return product; select with confidence.",0
"I have always had a inferiority complex when learning foreign languages.  I nearly failed my high school Latin class and hated studying grammer.

Why then can I enthusiastically recommend Rosetta Stone Italian?  In a word, it is fun!

If you are not familiar with their approach, Rosetta Stone immerses you in the language through photos, repetition and contextural clues.  The photographs are beautiful,  the voiceovers are rich, the challenges interesting.  You learn by doing, repeating and adding variety.  It is like being dropped in the middle of Italy with nothing but your time and your willingness to learn.

In the beginning, it is easy to build your vocabulary, as you respond to prompts.  Later as you build, you learn more grammer, the same way you learned English, through example. If you are patient and work hard, more and more puzzle pieces will fall into place. Though I am in the early stages of the process, I have no doubt that I can get a good working understanding of the language over a period of months if I am diligent.

Is Rosetta Stone worth it?

I haven't tried all the programs but have purchased Instant Immersion and Pimseluer but I have found they do not hold my interest like the Rosetta Stone version.  Though the other programs are a fraction of the cost, they don't seem to make me want to learn like the Rosetta Stone program.

My conclusion is that Rosetta Stone works.  That means value to me.",0
"One for being a new OS and one for being a successor OS. As a new paradigm, I'd give it a 5. As a successor to Win7? Not even a 2. It's a fork of the OS family - not an advancement. You would think MS would have learned this. Every other release sucks. Perhaps that's by intent - a learning experience that users will pay to vent about. MS then collects the information and uses it to produce a working OS.

Thus, Win3.11 leads to NT3.5 which in turn leads to NT4 and then WinME/2000 to Vista (oh wait, two failures in a row!) to Win7 (the big winner since NT4) and now, Win8.

If you're a touch user or a tablet user or a new user or a user who just wants a computer for social media interaction and some document management plus photo manipulation, congrats. Win 8 is for you. Once you figure it out. Apps for you to buy and MS to sell you and make money with. Applications to do real work. A desktop for that occasional use - once you know where it is.

But if you're a dev or a power user of any kind. Wow. No way. Win 7 or perhaps a general move to Mac. Sure, you'll lose a lot of software and the software you do get will most likely be a generation behind, but you'll have superior hardware and a better interface.

Come on MS. Release Win8 for the masses. We get that. Then release Win8Power or Win8Pro or Win8Real. Whatever. Don't make things like the desktop and multi-tasking and the start menu afterthoughts. Don't make me buy Apple.

So - are you old? Don't care about computers outside the love you'd give a toaster? Then Win8 is for you.

Are you a computer user instead of an app user? Then Win8 is a mess. Just a hot mess. Stick with Win7 and wait for Win9. Pray that they learn their lesson and don't drink their own kool aid. And if they do? Well, it'll give you time to save up for that MacBookPro you want. Or iMac 27"".",0

"If you know Autodesk, you probably are not even reading this review. Basically, you would locate the newest release and order it. You do not have to guess that users will report an unparalleled experience. And, it should go without saying, these products are known for being flawless (no bugs, no freezing, no crashing, ever). With Autodesk, the price is a direct reflection of the product's quality. It's not too often this one find this caliber of excellence and company integrity.

If you are new to Autodesk and nervous about this investment for your company, you can allay all those fears. This is the gold-standard for the small business.
And, you will find that this is the consensus among those in the field.

Note the revisions made (as detailed above) and know that each lives up to your expectations. Likewise, you will find even more information at Autodek's website. (This product is a little difficult to find, so simply go to the products list and then click ""AutoCAD Revit LT Suite."")

We installed this on a high-end desktop. Needless to say, we encountered no concerns. (We have used Autodesk products in the past and were expecting noething short of perfection. That is precisely what we found). Nonetheless, I inquired with a number of people if the software would be as effective with an upscale laptop. The response was a resounding yes. (Obviously, check the system requirements above, on the right-hand side of the page ... especially if you are not going to be the operator of this software).

Likewise, the one-year subscription is invaluable. The benefits are (this list is direct from the manufacturer to insured accuracy):

  -Autodesk 360 Rendering--Create photorealistic images and panoramas using our Rendering cloud services with your Autodesk 360 account.
  -Software upgrades--Stay current with the latest releases and product enhancements.
  -Flexible licensing--Work with previous versions of your software. Use it at home or in multiple locations.
  -Technical support--Resolve issues and get back to work with online help from product support specialists.

As noted repeatedly, this is aimed at small businesses. So purchase accordingly.

Buy this software with absolute confidence.",0
"This is a fairly inexpensive way to get the use of Photoshop and Lightroom, but you need to understand that you will not own the program. This is essentially a one-year subscription to these programs, and you will need to resubscribe if you want to continue using the programs after the year ends.

There are pros and cons to using the software this way versus purchasing the incredibly expensive software. People have different opinions on this, but if you're like me you can't afford the full versions of the software, and with the subscription system you won't cringe when the newer versions come out.

That being said, Photoshop and Lightroom are outstanding programs. Photoshop is the industry standard and will allow you to manipulate images in just about any way you can imagine. Lightroom is more of an organizer type of software that enables you to do editing and sharing.

One of the nicer features about this version is that you can use your mobile device, and it will sync with your desktop. You also will be sure that you have the most recent versions of Photoshop and Lightroom.

This is an ideal option if you need Photoshop and Lightroom and don't have lots of money.",0
"Cyberlink PowerDVD 15 Ultra is a great video playback product.  The installation is rather straightforward but you will need to connect your laptop or PC to the internet to activate the license key.

"I am a huge fan of Norton products - and have used it exclusively for all my personal devices since around 2003. The fact that this software is provided free by my cable provider is simply icing on the cake.

The latest iteration of this suite is just as great. I am running it on a 7-year old Core Duo 2 with 2GB RAM (Win 7 x64), and it still runs like a champ without hogging my system's resources.

The old standby features are all still there - my favorite being Norton's File Insight which gives you a trust rating on downloaded files, Quick/Full scans, and the user interface retains the familiar tabbed-window look.

The new Backup feature also follows very familiar idioms for this category of software. You pick the What (files and folders), Where (the destination), and When (the frequency), and it does the rest.

Overall, this is a recommended upgrade to a software staple.",0
"I was excited to see AutoCAD finally developed and (almost) perfected for Mac. I have a few years of experience working with AutoCAD so this was relatively easy for me to dive into and experiment with, but if you're a new user, be forewarned you will need to educate yourself on it. AutoCAD is not a program you can just jump into and learn with some trial and error. Consider watching some online help videos and perhaps doing a little reading on it as well. I'd say at least 5-6 hours of research and learning would be ideal before you actually try it out.

If you're a longtime user of AutoCAD on the PC, you should be able to load this onto your Mac and get a feel for it with very few or no problems whatsoever. The program is full-featured and bursting with options. The 3D aspect works flawlessly from what I've seen. The only real downside here is the outrageous price. Some may mark it down for that aspect, but the way I view it is if you need this solution and you're comfortable paying a pretty penny for it, by all means go for it. It works, and in a competitive field where results are all that matters, sometimes that's worth paying a premium for.",0

Today, I tried Photo Director 6 on an iMac. I'd say the whole thing went pretty well.

It is very easy to install. Just click through the setup, and it's easy to find in Launchpad. It will prompt you at the bottom of the screen to import your pictures the first time the program opens. Takes a while to upload (mine didn't finish the first time--meaning, I got really annoyed with the program and iPhoto and closed it before it had finished uploading), but you can work on pictures while it's uploading.

So I decided to look at/edit photos from a trip to San Francisco, Carmel, and London. You can see the photos and narratives in my video.  I did some object removal, photo clean-up, color alterations, background removal, exposure setting changes, cropping, and more.

About the Fisherman's Wharf picture, where I removed the black triangle in the corner and the power cord: This was so easy to do! There are automatic tools for literally all of this. It even recreated the letters across the Fisherman's Wharf sign. Impressive!

Adjusting the RGB curve is simple.

Adding noise is easy, but looks more extreme in the program. The photos don't show the high amounts of ""noise"" that I added as much as I thought they would.

The background removal tool doesn't work too well if your background is blurry.  But in my example, it worked well (and it was very simple to use).  In my example, I added a new background to make it look like he was in a more natural environment.

My first complaint: it is so hard to find photos.  I edited the Fisherman's Wharf photo twice because I tried to move it from iPhoto to my Desktop so that I could share it. Moving it caused Photo Director to lose it. I could not find the edited version in either iPhoto or my Desktop, or, for that matter, Photo Director. It was just gone. So I had to edit it again. Now I can't find the 1st butterfly photo with the background removed.

The London photo was edited using the ""People Beautifier"" tool.  I only used a few of the features, but it is very simple and the results can be drastic.  The close-up screenshots show how  much better the picture looks with the skin tone adjusted and the environment brightened up.

So, the bottom line:
- Export your photos as soon as you're done editing them, or else good luck finding them again.
- This program has great features to automatically edit photos, but there are no automatic adjustments (e.g., contrast, tone, curves)
- This is a great, cheaper alternative to Photoshop.
- It works with a Mac. (Hurray!)
- If you are familiar with Photoshop, you will have no problem with this program.
- If you have never edited a photo in your life, this program is much more simplistic than Photoshop (and other major photo editing programs), but can do a lot of the same things.

This program is not perfect, but I no longer feel the need to go buy myself a copy of Photoshop.",0

"I am surprised to see other users referring to problems with this software.  I can speak only for myself (and, for the record, my operating system is Windows XP Home edition), but I made an exceedingly smooth transition from Norton AntiVirus 2002 and Norton Personal Firewall 2002 to Norton Internet Security 2003.  All of my established settings came over without a hitch, I am having no problem at all scanning incoming and outgoing email messages, and the firewall would definitely appear to be doing its job.  The AntiVirus program now has the added capability of scanning instant messages, which is a very big deal, in my opinion.  The Spam Alert function is not quite perfect at distinguishing between true spam and valid messages, but it is a feature of at least some utility, and I am happy to see Symantec trying to incorporate it into their already excellent software package.  The Privacy Control feature is not new, but it is certainly an important part of the deal, affording the user some protection from the accidental release of important personal and financial information across the Internet.  I can't comment on the Parental Control feature because I do not use it, but certainly this is something parents will find appealing.  Last and certainly not least, this software allows you to block a great number of those increasingly annoying pop-up ads proliferating online.
If this is your first time using the firewall software, you will have to go through some important steps in order to configure your security system for your own needs, but the system walks you through this pretty well, meaning you don't need to be a computer expert to do it.  You will also have to specify any personal information (such as credit card numbers) you want to protect from accidental release via web forms and the like, but this is not hard to do.  You can quickly and easily run a security check at any time to make sure your security settings are optimized and working properly.

"CorelDraw's Graphic Suites do the work of several graphic programs (both pixel and vector based) combined, and although they might not be as fancy as Adobe's graphics software when combined with each other and a host of add ons, they give you more than what most people--even graphic professionals like myself--would want at less than half the price. CorelDraw just keeps getting better and better, and this version is the best one yet.

I've been using CorelDraw for years, and for years my fellow digital artists have told me I need to ""upgrade"" to Adobe software. I studied computer graphics on Macs using Adobe programs at a digital-art school, but when I came home I practiced the same things using CorelDraw. There really wasn't much of a difference, except that the Adobe interface was prettier but oddly a little less intuitive.

All my friends pushed me to buy a Mac and get Adobe software. ""It's the only thing artists use,"" they said. ""We just don't use PCs. Macs are designed for creative people, and so is Adobe software.""

""But Adobe programs cost more, and you have to buy several to do the same things as one CorelDraw Suite,"" I replied. ""Some things that come standard in CorelDraw require add-ons in PhotoShop or Freehand, and that means you have to pay even more.""

They pointed out deals for students. I could get Adobe software for about half the retail cost. That made sense for something I needed, but what I already had for less than half the price of one of those programs was already fulfilling my needs. Did I really need to spend that much more to be like everyone else?

I talked to a friend who ran a graphics studio. The artists working under her all worked with Adobe programs ... and she would fix their mistakes in CorelDraw. Then I went to work at a newspaper, where I created illustrations on my PC using scanned images and CorelDraw's Photo-Paint from the CorelDraw Graphics Suite. I exported my images in PNG format, and the layout artist had no problem putting them into pages in the software on his Mac. They looked fine in the newspaper when they were printed.

So while Macs and Adobe might be the industry standard, you won't be left out in the cold if you save your money and choose not to join the crowd.

Two last things:
1. As with all graphics programs, there is a learning curve. However, if you already know one kind well, like PhotoShop, it shouldn't be too hard to adjust to another, like Photo-Paint, which is a part of this suite.

2. CorelDraw tends to try new things with odd numbered releases, so the odd numbered ones tend to be a bit buggier than the even numbered ones. It's usually best to wait for an even numbered suite before you buy.",0

"Let's face it: a lot of computer-assisted instruction is just plain lame or worse.

They can suffer from either being rote memorization schemes or over-glorified games or simply textbooks in electronic form.

Rare is a system that truly utilizes what computers can do best to solidly teach concepts.

Rosetta Stone delivers.

It teaches language using multiple sensory inputs (picture & voice) and multiple feedback mechanisms (your voice and hand-eye choices).  It is able to adjust and compensate for your learning speed and strengths on the fly.  It is engaging without being just a game.  And it is able to effectively teach without English--- which is the closest you can get to a dedicated immersion course.

I had previously installed and used the Spanish & Italian Rosetta Stone, and found that it was easy to install the German Rosetta Stone as a 3rd language onto my base installation on my computer.  It's easy to switch between languages and users & keep track of your progress with each.

Bottom line:  I am very impressed.  My ten year old loves it, actually WANTS to do the lessons.  I'm having fun with it too, even though languages are definitely not my strong suit.  If you want to learn a language on your own, this is the best way I know to do it.",0

"My youngest son is a budding digital cartoonist, I got this software for him and here are some of his thoughts...

 ""I like how easy to use the software is. One could start doing simple animations in a matter of minutes, even learning the how to use the more advanced animating features such as the animation bones, which allows you to freely manipulate limbs on your characters', shouldn't take more than an hour or so. The software also comes with pre-made character templates for getting started immediately, as well as a custom character making tool for quickly creating your own characters.

  What I dislike about the software are all the limitations. I understand that the Debut version is supposed to be the lesser of the two versions, but I felt that some of the limitations may have been a bit unreasonable. Everytime I had a new idea for a cartoon, there always seemed to be a new limitation preventing me from making it. You cannot make animations longer than 2 minutes, or greater than 3000 frames. You also can't add more than two audio tracks, despite how short they may be, making dialogue a very difficult thing to add to your cartoons. As well as many other limitations that of course are not in the Pro version. If you are serious about going into animation, it might be worth it to go for the more expensive Anime Studio Pro 8"".

I have no problem at all with the program until I try to work with media files on my computer, at which point my computer overheats and has a thermal shut-down.

Pinnacle's Studio 18 has 3 different versions: Regular, Plus and Ultimate.  This version is the Plus, and is their mid-range program.

"I know I probably should wait a while before reviewing Windows 10, but I'm so happy with it that I decided I'll just update in the future if it goes bad on me.  Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.

Okay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.

Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.

It started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose ""off"" for all of them.  That didn't seem to slow down Windows 10 at all or mess it up or whatever.  Now, when I go online, I'm online in usually 60 seconds or so.  Firefox, Chrome and Windows Edge, which replaced IE, are all working well.  I can go from one browser to another with no problems.

"I'm going to do a short review here and say that Corel has some advantages over Photoshop for photomanipulation or editing. Where Photoshop Elements (a fine piece of software) has you estimate or use your monitor and judgment for fixing photos, CorelDraw's Photo suite has an Integrated Image Adjustment Lab --and it tells you how you are going to affect the data on a RAW image, losing image quality by various adjustments. Instead of eyeballing what you are doing, you can retain maximum detail in highlights and shadows using their sliders and suggestions. When you exceed the limits and start to lose detail, an exclamation point crops up on the slider, showing you that you have degraded the photo quality. This is probably the best photo editing software I've used for that reason.

While I like the competing PhotoShop Elements for ease of use and the fun effect, CorelDraw has more professional features and the interface for photoediting is full of information yet easy to use. Big thumbs up.",0

Sure, it took over an hour to install. When I restarted I opened mail and I was prompted for my mail settings (WHATT??).  However, when I hit the ""next"" prompt the mail started up with all my message intact (whew!).

Okay, so what's so good about Snow Leopard?  First of all, your system will run much faster.  Safari opens faster and text loads quicker when your browsing web pages (although the photos load a little slower it seems).

Mail seems to open faster.

The new ""aqua"" desktop looks a little nicer (okay, that's worth about $5 to me).

The system shuts down faster.

All in all, for $25, this is a very worthwhile upgrade that will feel like you just upgraded your system to a faster processor.

So, it's worth it. Now everybody, let's get with the program and rate this upgrade five stars!",0
"Not sure why folks like to post negative reviews about a product based on what they WISH it could do versus what the program is designed to do.  It does not have the same functionality as its big brother PDF Converter Pro, but it is not designed to.  This program does a perfectly fine job creating and combining PDFs.  No annotating, nor form-filling, etc.  But if all you want to do is create and combine PDFs, this is an excellent, economic alternative to Adobe.",0
"This application surprised me.  It is fast, easy to use and offers both Photoshop novices and pros a nice feature set.  While no application can replace Photoshop for certain things, some applications can provide the just the right mix to be worthwhile.  This application is worthwhile.

This application is also lightweight.  When it first loads, it is only using 39Mb of RAM on my system.  Photoshop uses 64MB.  I realize this is not a significant difference, but I provide it for comparison purposes.  After loading the same 6-megapixel photo, Pixelmator is using 63MB and Photoshop is using 101MB.

The standard features are all there: file-formats support, layers, filters, color-correction tools, drawing, cloning, and batch processing.  I especially like the black user interface.  The extra contrast provided by the black is useful when examining photos. There is iSight and iLife integration as well.

There are also some nice technical under-the-hood features like the ability to push some processing onto the GPU instead of the main CPU.

I would urge you to try the trial download an see for yourself.  This could very well be the ""elements-style"" application you are looking for.",0
"I have never been a fan of having to purchase anti-spyware/virus protection programs for my various computers in the past.  But at the same time I'm even less of a fan than getting spyware or viruses on my computer...

Over the years I've tried many different programs from many different companies, and one of the biggest complaints I always had was that I just wasn't entirely sure what these programs where doing to my computer, what they were running, and how much active memory they were taking up (some of the old programs on windows 95 would make the computer almost unusable).

But about three years ago I finally gave norton a try and I will never look back.  This program come with everything you honestly need to keep your computer safe (especially when the proper window's settings are in place) and you don't feel like quiet a dummy when you try to figure out the interfaces - everything is more or less simple.  And my computer still runs as smoothly than before I installed the program :)",0
"Willmaker Plus was exactly what my family and I needed to prepare for an unexpected death.  It took you step by step and for anyone who has used a tax prep program will find the format similar.  It asks you questions to see what is pertinent to your situation and prompts you for the information that you need.  What was really helpful was that you could stop and save and pick it up at a later date.  This was nice since I didn't have all of the info I needed at my fingertips so I was able to get that, then pick up where I left off.

Even if you have more complex arrangements to make, especially in the case of divorce I think you will find that Willmaker Plus will cover you needs.  One thing that we needed was a promissory note in addition to just a will and I was sooo happy that that option was also included into this program as well.  It covered everything that we needed and make a not so pleasant task easy.  I highly recommend it.  It installed easily, and was easy to use.  I would buy it again without any hesitation!",0

"I've always found Nolo products to be very informative and useful, and this software package is no exception.

I use Windows 7. The software installed without a hitch. Some have complained that it doesn't work on a Mac, and others that Windows won't recognize it but for me it works fine. Perhaps it is ""OE"" that is plaguing the other reviewers.

As for the product itself: it has the ability to put together a will and also produce many other useful documents. I'd say for most people, their needs would be met by this product.  If you have an unusual situation then you may want to consult an attorney but for the average joe, this should be just fine.  I can imagine that attorneys would advise NOT to use such a product because the layman is not aware of issues that may exist that only a professional attorney can uncover and resolve (which may be true) but you just have to use your common sense and decide if your situation warrants having to pay someone to do what this product can do just fine. Most of the time the attorney just hands it off to a clerk to do and then reviews it and charges big bucks, with a result that often isn't all that great anyway in terms of grammar and professionalism.  I figure this will make some attorneys angry but I'm only relating what I've observed in real life. As I said, use your common sense and good judgement as to whether this product is adequate.  I feel it offers enough guidance and information to be useful for the majority of the population.

The software also comes with a useful book, ""The Legal Answer Book For Families.""  I've always found Nolo to be a trusted source for information and I have quite a few of their books.  This software is no exception.",0
"Poser 9 is such an engaging and fun interface to work with. I am thrilled with this latest release. The presentation is gorgeous; the entire workspace is brilliantly refined.

The well-balanced user interface provides efficient navigation. As always, numerous interface tweaks may be applied and saved to easily accessible memory dots, and when combined with presets of common 3D workflow layouts, it makes preparing for and alternating between tasks almost effortless.

The new features and the core rendering enhancements are quite significant and they target not only the desires of the casual user but also the needs of the most dedicated artists and illustrators. Accessibility defines Poser 9! Vertex weight maps, subsurface scattering, tablet support for the morph tool, Python 2.7, faster hair and (thankfully) framing a selected objet with a toggle to rotate around the selected object describes some of the most welcome, but not the only, additions and enhancements to the software.

I love Poser 9! When I take into account how much I enjoy using it compared to previous versions, I can officially rank it as a heavy hitter as far as quality products go. It is worth the upgrade regardless of which version one comes from, and it is definitely worth the investment for curious new users who can pretty much just install it and take over the creative reins immediately.

It's clear to see the efforts made by the development team in order to make this such an incredible tool.",0

"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",0
"So far so good - this is a comprehensive and powerful application for big business accounting - in addition to budget and payroll, there are excellent tools for tracking growth and profit.

I'm just starting to scratch the surface as to what it can and can't do - so far, I can say that the software is user friendly, although there is a steep learning curve if you aren't an accountant!",0
"Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.",0

"I bought it two month ago, my modem and router are like 50 yards away from my bedroom, I was trying to get some internet access while I was watching tv or looking over my child, it was impossible not only for the distance, it was also for the material of the walls of the house, it is some kind of hard concrete that blocks away any type of signals, even 900 mhz frecuency from my wireless phones. I tried getting out the wireless router and aim it to the room, it did not work. I tried buying a wireless signal extender, did not work eather, I tried buying an extra large antenna that comes with a long cable, I hooked it to my router and put it rigth in the hallway aiming directly to my bedroom, it showed some signal but poorly enough to not be accesible. I was comited to find the solution and while I was searching around the internet I found this product. dessperate as I was I decided to try it even if I did not have any prior reference of it. I came home, hooked it and it has not stopped working since. I recomended it widely, easy to set up and noiseless.

"I started my computer ""career"" on Apple II computers with big floppy drivers, green screen monitors, and a whopping 48kb of RAM! Those were the days. Ever since, we have been striving for the perfect computing experience where it is about the creative work or otherwise being done, not the work being done to keep the computer happy.

Soon after the Apple II days, I spent time on a Sperry Univac before finally settling into MS-DOS on an IBM and then an HP; this lead to Windows 3.1, 95, 98, NT, (not) ME, 2000, XP, and the oh-so-not-ready for primetime Vista. Along the way, I operated a Graphics Lab that was half Windows NT workstations and half Apple Mac OS 9 computers. Those were not the days...I spent too much time getting them to talk to each other, to see the file server, and just keeping them running efficiently.

Then there were Mac OS X and Mac Pro workstations! My creative work environment has been reinvented. But, there is always a legacy, and mine is Windows software without a Mac version or without a migration option - some things just can't get there from here...until now.

Parallels Desktop allows for multiple virtual Windows machines to be created in Mac OS X; and, not just Windows, but Linux, OS/2 (people still use that??), FreeBSD, Sun Solaris, and plain old MS-DOS (talk about some serious legacy issues if you need this). I have no experience with the other OSs listed, but as far as Windows goes, it is amazing! Each virtual machine is a self contained computer to the operating system using it, and Parallels Desktop handles all of the communications with the hardware and the Mac file system and drag and drop capabilities between the two operating systems.

Parallels Desktop creates disk image for each virtual machine that grows in size as the VM requires; this disk image holds all of the files - system, programs, and data - that is installed on the VM. It also offers an option to have your Mac documents folder and your desktop serve as the documents folder and desktop on your VM, streamlining the storage of all of your valuable files in one place.

The single greatest accomplishment of this software is the Coherence Mode. This mode eliminates the window housing the VM and moves the Windows Task Bar and Start Menu down to the bottom of your Mac desktop. Any software or folder window you open from the Windows VM opens in its own window on the Mac and looks like a Windows window instead of a Mac window - you will always know where and what you are working on.
Parallels Desktop also includes some nifty tools as well. The Snapshot feature allows you create a backup snapshot of your VM at anytime and revert back to it if necessary. But, the best tool, is Parallels Explorer, which allows you to view and work with the file system of the VM when it is not running.

If I had one criticism, it would be how CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs are handled between the two - essentially, you have to connect to the CD/DVD drive for the Windows VM to see it, and if you are installing a multi-disk software package, you have to continually connect and disconnect to the drive...it is very laborious. I would like to see a more fluid and automatic process in the future.

Overall, this is amazing software that blurs the line between Mac and Windows and allows for the best of both worlds. My Windows XP install runs better in the Parallels Desktop virtual machine than it did on my high-end laptop!",0

"I've used Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal and State for the past 2 years with no issues. However, this year the cost of e-filing went up and coupled with the price of the software is just too much in my opinion to spend. Based on some recommendations here, I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal Version (only) with Free e-file and since my state has a website to do the state taxes for free, I opted to do that. I am so glad that I read the reviews here because I never even knew that my state offered the ability to do my state taxes online .. and for Free! I couldn't be happier about the savings! As always Turbo Tax was fairly easy to use (took about an hour) and as it turns out my State taxes were easy too (took about 20 minutes).

1. Make sure your state offers the ability to do your taxes online and for free before purchasing this program.
2. Make sure you file your federal taxes first.
3. Then you can move on to your state taxes.

Side Note: In the state of Indiana, in order to do your state taxes on their website, it was required that I had filed Indiana state taxes in the previous year (this does not mean using their online ability last year, it just means I either mailed them in or efiled some other way for the state of Indiana). If your state offers the ability to do your taxes online, read their FAQ section to make sure you qualify to use their service before you purchase this product.",0

"Although the new AutoCAD LT 2010 may not offer everything its big brother does, it's a great choice if you only need to do 2D drawings.

+DWG is the most commonly used design format
+Save in older file formats for collaborators using older versions
+Supports PDF files as an Underlay
+Improved Layer Management
+True Color Support
+Publish to PDF format for anyone to view project even without having a CAD program
+You can upgrade if you are using AutoCAD LT 2007 or higher

Keep in mind the limitations of the LT Version of AutoCAD 2010 such as:
-No 3D drawings are possible, 2D only
-No 3D modeling, so no walk-through or photorealistic rendering
-No Network Licensing

Bottom Line: AutoCAD LT 2010 is a great product if you need to do 2D drawings. The price point is probably worth it to professional users because of the new options and being able to open all DWG formats, as well as save in older formats in case you collaborate with others using older versions.  Those unable to afford the Full AutoCAD package may find the LT version meets their needs.",0

"There is nothing like enjoying a product enough that you want to share it with everyone. There is also nothing like enjoying a product that stops spreading things to others.

You get a report of how it protects you and if you stumble onto something suspicious on the web, it'll alert you and prevent you from downloading it/viewing it. I have used Norton but find that Kaspersky is more on the ball with their protection.

"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.",0

Before installing this product, I could get an average of 8 hours use on one battery charge, and with this installed and doing it's thing, I still get an average of 8 hours.

A great program that easily identifies unsafe websites.  You install it and forget it, as you will not hear a peep from this program, as if it wasn't there.  You can see the results just by going to Google.  It uses a simple green, yellow and red system to identify the website.  As you hover over a link, it will give you a more extensive review of the website.  I'm an avid surfer and even I was amazed how some of the website I used to think are safe are not necessarily safe.  This is even a great tool for parents to educate their kids about net safety by explaining to them not to click on anything that McAfee marks as a suspect.  Overall, McAfee Site Advisor Plus is a great addition to any PC.",0
"I have used this to put all my papers, business cards,power cords and my Microsoft Surface.  It is perfect for visiting clients.",0
"This program should be banned. It often creates more problems than it is supposed to fix. It will make changes to your computer that will make it unuseable and you will need to be an expert to fix them. I have given up on Acronis, they have no tech support, at least none that answers questions. I suspect they know their software is buggy and not very good so they ignore those users with problems.

I need to make images of my main drive so I was going to try Acronis one more time to make a clone image (exact copy). Now it cannot even find any hard drives on my computer and it has 3! I reinstalled the program and still doesn't work. I tried uninstalling it and cannot even do that! Absolutely no answers from Acronis either. You would be better off throwing your computer out the window before using anything from Acronis.

It is interesting that after I posted this review, there was a reply supposedly from Acronis Customer Support. I believe the response is not really from Acronis. Why? Because I made repeated efforts to contact Acronis in different ways and the only response I ever received was about a month later asking if the support ticket could be closed!

There is so much better software out there and some is free! Try EASEUS backup software, I have used it repeatedly to clone drives and partitions and have never had a problem.",1
I used this item in an older laptop that had only wireless G.  It is a perfect upgrade due to the super small form factor.  It does tie up a USB port but you can hardly see the adapter once its on.,0
"I use this software to edit a small web series. There are few special effects, but it does well with small things (integrating a car chase and animation, in my case). This software is a vital tool for clarifying picture and color on a budget. I run Windows 8 Enterprise on a Lenovo All-In-One, and this runs smoothly without conflicting with other programs or causing issues (which Corel always did to me). If you have simple projects that don't require a whole lot of special effects, this is a good budget program, and I definitely recommend it.",0
"Unlike Vista, Windows 7 is a very good operating system. It is stable and inherits the familiar functions that existed in previous versions.

Unfortunately, it is not perfect. I do experience freezing of the screen, disappearance of the cursor, and the inability to install programs. A hard reboot will often make these problems go away. . . . In other words, I can live with these annoyances.",0
"I like it because I'm familiar with this software, via their Edit Pro MX.  This 2016 version has some improvements over the older versions, and a bug fixed on the title function (I can move the title bar anywhere, and the video bars stay where you leave them).  It's easy to overlap, fade in & out, black out, reduce volume or remove it; sharpen and brighten.  I don't like the fancy effects; just good, solid editing is what I need. This one works for me.",0

"This is a cross-platform internet security package (devices like phones are covered) and it resembles the standalone antivirus package.

I'd never been a fan of McAfee, but it seems to be on par with Norton for security and has a lot of features I like.  There is a  vulnerability scanner, a virtual file shredder, and a cleanup tool to remove the leftover bits of files that are remaining when you delete or de-install software, and you can scrub traces of your online activity.  You are alerted to potentially dangerous web pages and  links. If for some reason you have turned off the anti-virus, the WebAdvisor alerts you before you go online (I appreciate that. Some software installations require you turn off the anti-virus and it's easy to forget to turn it on again before venturing online.)

You also get protection for non-Windows device such as your Android Smartphone and tablet (I use both.) This is the selling point for me--I am always forgetting--hello, the phone and the Kindle go online You can install McAfee Antivirus & Security Premium on  your Android devices and get antivirus, anti-theft, and a privacy reporter for apps, which is also good, because many game apps have a lot of things you DON'T want, snooping around your tablet or phone. Apps can be pin coded, helpful if you have a child who grabs your phone or tablet to play with. This has happened to me; the minute I'm visiting with a friend's ten year old, he's onto the Kindle looking for games. I can set up a user profile for him and shut him out of things I don't want him to have access to.

Apple users will be less thrilled: there are fewer features for MAC and iOS support is also more limited.",0
Cleans out a few files. Does nothing else but put you on an annoying email list.,1
Used online cleaners much more expensive.  The Amazon Cleaner was wonderful freed up junk and clutter and so happy with it I got a copy for my daughter and my son in law  and the church computer.,0
"I thought it would be hard to improve upon the 2015 version of Painter but there are tons of additions/improvements, including the ability to import Adobe Photoshop .abr brush files, retaining such things as dab shape, texture, dynamics, but note that other attributes which are not supported will require some customization of brushes after import...at least an encouraging improvement that will probably be tweaked and further improved in future versions.  Most important to me is improved performance and stability with brushes up to three times faster, not to mention tons of new brushes.  You can also now rotate paper texture and flow maps.  There is a dedicated icon for default settings restoration where you can preserve custom brushes, palettes and paper textures. You can switch between default, single document and presentation views from three different areas (toolbox, window menu, keyboard shortcuts).  They have added the very cool Dynamic Speckles, the speckles in the brushstroke being generated as you paint.  Also new is Audio Expression, brushes that react to sound, using audio from streaming music or your computer's microphone which you can sync to brush controls like brush size, angle, color.  Also very helpful are visual tool tips with illustrations which show how your attempted adjustments will affect the custom brushes applied to your creation. You can now personalize your workspace by modifying the UI color scheme.

My favorite area is working with existing photographs as I'm just better at transforming than creating from scratch.  There is something for everyone, photo artists, traditional artists, illustrators, or just non-categorical individuals who want to have some creative fun.

If you are not already familiar with this type of program be aware that there is a pretty steep learning curve.  Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time just to get started, with possibly hours of viewing tutorials and instructions and practice, practice and more practice....but if you are willing and determined there are many talented and helpful users willing to share their expertise via video on You Tube and other sites.  The place to start is the Corel site itself which provides integrated training which automatically updates based on what you have already viewed on the site.

Another consideration before deciding to purchase Corel Painter is that it does require higher CPU and memory resources, which is to be expected with any advanced graphically intense software, so make sure you carefully check the system requirements.",0
I have been using norton security for over 15 years and will continue. I like a lot compared to the other programs I've tried.,0

"This is a fairly expensive piece of software, but it does a lot. It allows you to do word-processing, including letters, reports and newsletters. You can create complex spreadsheets that can be turned into charts and graphs for visual presentations. You can create slideshows, proposals and other interactive reports. You can create PDF files. You can manage your email, use online services to collaborate with people across the country and around the world, and you can store, collect and use information from almost any source imaginable. In short, this program works much like Microsoft Office and is compatible with it.
I highly recommend this suite of programs for people who, like me, have their own home business. It's one-stop shopping for almost anything you could need.",0
Great price from a company that also provides massive amounts of help for all your communication needs.,0
"I've been using QuickBooks Pro since 1996 when I started my own business. I hate upgrading but the last time I did it was in 2010. So I just got a new computer and I couldn't install my old version (2010). It was time to buy a new version. I always buy the disk version since I can reinstall it at will and the download may not always be available.

I had no trouble importing my company data and so far, I really appreciate the new look and functionality. I'm sure I'll find a lot more changes but for now, I'm happy.

***Update*** I did run into a couple of glitches. I ended up having to do some kind of check on my data and it all cleared up though. No issues since.",0

"I just switched to an iMac after using PC's for many years, and VMware's Fusion has been a huge convenience for me. I have a few Windows applications (Quicken, Outlook for it's task functionality) for which I can't find acceptable Mac counterparts. Fusion allows you to run a fully functional Windows instance on the Mac, and it does so seamlessly. I actually run my Windows instance on a separate monitor, giving me access to fully functional Mac and Windows apps from one computer.

It seems that the Windows applications run a bit slower than they would on a native Windows computer, but not enough to be an inconvenience to me. I'm very happy with this purchase and would be using two separate computers if it weren't for Fusion.",1
"I used to have Norton for years.  After all it was the industry standard, but after it let many a virus slip on through; I had enough.

I knew I would not get McAfee as I have repaired many computers with Mcaffee in the past (working in the computer field.)

So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings.  I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky.

Well two years later I have not looked back.  I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out.  They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc.  After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle.

When I had Norton, I would have to email them or be charged $40 for a phone call after their software let a virus in.  Talk about nerve.  No more, Trend Micro is head and shoulders above the rest!",0

"I make the occasional YouTube video among other things. I've mostly used Adobe Premiere Elements over the years, though I also have used the various built-in Windows apps and other half-versions that came with DVD drives and the like. That said, I'm no expert at video making. I don't delve into all the settings or do too many tricky things. Usually, I'm looking to just add a soundtrack to a video or to set up some simple menus and chapters to write a DVD. I use this software as a beginner just looking to get something done without a steep learning curve. From that perspective, this stuff was the best. It took me about a half hour to load in a 60 minute video, locate a half dozen chapters, and set up the DVD menus. That was perfect for my purposes. The most challenging thing I had to do was edit a menu template to allow more than the default three chapter buttons on a page.

The one hassle I had with the install was entering the product key. They need to do a better job with their printing of the product key sticker, as mine was hard to read. Took three or four tries with ambiguous letters before I got it to go through. Everything else about the install went very smoothly. It was also relatively easy to get updates and there is a library of additional themes a couple clicks away if you want to download someone else's DVD menu ideas.

There are definitely some aspects of this software that aren't quite right. Working with customizing menu pages was a bit clunky, but it seemed like it would go easy enough once one was thoroughly familiar with the way things worked. You certainly could get to what you want, it just might take a little more effort than you feel should be necessary to get there.

The one major reason for five stars is that I recorded a show off the DVR a few weeks ago and wanted to write it to DVD. I used a Hauppauge product to make the capture, and the video played perfectly on my PC. Then, I tried to cut it to an archival DVD and no software that I had access to would keep the audio and video in sync. It drove me crazy that any software I had would play the file just fine, but nothing could write it to a DVD. I ordered this product as a last attempt to complete that project and I'm pleased to say that it worked perfectly. That was enough to get my vote!",0

"This review is entirely from the perspective of people looking at Photoshop alternatives, now that Adobe has switched to a monthly fee model with Creative Cloud.

I use to do computer graphics and fine arts more than a decade ago, but I don't work in that field, and so I only actually need to use a high end graphics program every few months or so.  I've used Photoshop for more than 10 years, but now that Adobe has gone to Creative Cloud with a monthly rental but no purchase option, I need an alternative.  I don't do graphics often enough to justify a monthly fee on the Adobe Creative Cloud plan, and I have concerns about whether I will be able to open files years into the future unless I can own the software.  My personal alternative is the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GIMP has a clunky user interface.  And, I also recommend software for a small university library where students and staff are also looking for something for occasional use.

Corel Painter 2015 has a decent user interface.  I was able to do simple edits quickly and intuitively.  I was also able to use the User Guide to quickly find and follow instructions for applying a mask.  There are a lot of options, because you can do a lot for it, so I think it's better for someone who has used a high-end graphics program before or who wants to be able to do more.  It was easy to find instructions for using the software.  There is a big long PDF User Guide, tutorials on YouTube (this is officially how Corel makes the tutorials available), and by Googling I could find websites where people talked about using the software.  So, you will be able to quickly find instructions on doing common tasks in Corel Painter.  One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.  I won't necessarily be able to go back to a tutorial a few years from now, since I can't store them with the software.

All in all, this is perfectly adequate software for editing digital images, and has a range that goes all the way up to fine arts.  There is a 30 day free trial to demo the software, and you can get this from Corel's website to try the software out.",0

"I can't believe this upgrade isn't getting a solid five star rating!!!

Sure, it took over an hour to install. When I restarted I opened mail and I was prompted for my mail settings (WHATT??).  However, when I hit the ""next"" prompt the mail started up with all my message intact (whew!).

Okay, so what's so good about Snow Leopard?  First of all, your system will run much faster.  Safari opens faster and text loads quicker when your browsing web pages (although the photos load a little slower it seems).

Mail seems to open faster.

The new ""aqua"" desktop looks a little nicer (okay, that's worth about $5 to me).

The system shuts down faster.

All in all, for $25, this is a very worthwhile upgrade that will feel like you just upgraded your system to a faster processor.

So, it's worth it. Now everybody, let's get with the program and rate this upgrade five stars!",0
"After 6 years of faithful service, my hard drive died a few weeks ago. I bought another Gateway and it was recommended to me that I get Spy Sweeper.

I had never ran any Spy tool up until now, choosing just to use Anti-Virus Software. I had wondered if Spy Sweeper would be redundant.

Well, I have Spy Sweeper 5.0.7.1608 and within the first few days of having my new computer, this software caught 3 incidents of spyware that my Anti-Virus never detected!

This tool sweeps files, registry, cookies...everything. It will quarantine first, and then you can choose to delete it.

My system is FAST, and I've not seen Spy Sweeper act unusually in any way, nor has it taken up too much memory. (I have AMD Athlon, 64 X2 dual core processor 3800+ with 1.87 GB of RAM--running on XP.) I have all 12 recommended shields running at all times.

Spy Sweeper will sweep every week, but you can choose to sweep anytime. Sweeps, for me, have only taken 5-6 minutes.

My experience has been very positive with Spy Sweeper, especially when I saw it catch several spyware that my Anti-Virus *didn't* pick up. Very affordable software for the kind of protection it provides, in my opinion.",0

While the application was written for Windows Vista/XP I was able to install and run it on Windows 7 (RC).

Overall I found this application extremely useful and the integration with Office applications was a pleasant bonus. Highly recommended for anyone that travels for business (by car) and needs a great tool to make the task easier and more productive.",0

"I can't change the rating stars on this, so I will just preface my edited review instead.  My enthusiasm for this product would be total were it not for McAfee's inability to resolve a simple problem:  How to register the product so that the defense files would be updated regularly.

All that was accomplished after 5 separate sessions with McAfee Support was the exhaustion of my patience and the rising of my temper.

Go ahead and try this product, I still mean everything that I wrote below.  Maybe your version will install and register just fine.  My version won't and I'm returning the CD to McAfee.

==========================

Maybe I wouldn't be so enthusiastic about McAfee Total Protection 2008 if I hadn't had such a bad experience with Microsoft OneCare.  That said, for me... this product is everything that OneCare is NOT!  It's easy to install, taking only a few minutes on my Vista-powered machine and it nicely coexists with all of my software and peripherals, even to the point of finally (yes.. finally) making the network connection between my Sony Vaio notebook and my wife's iMac work.

How ironic is it that McAfee could coexist better with Vista than Microsoft's own product?

If you're confused by the disparity between various reviews of McAfee Total Protection 2008, I can't say as I blame you.  But in truth, that's the nature of the beast when it comes to personal computing these days.  Memory usage, processor speed and cache responsiveness will influence what works for you (and against you) while the guy next door working with a different configuration will get totally different results.  So with that in mind, here's a link to the PC that I installed this product on
a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-VAIO-VGN-N220E-B-15-4-Laptop-Intel-Pentium-D-T2060-1-6-GHz-Processor-1-GB-RAM-80-GB-Hard-Drive-DVD-RW-Drive-Vista-Premium-Black/dp/B000M5NJPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony VAIO VGN-N220E/B 15.4"" Laptop (Intel Pentium D T2060 1.6 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD RW Drive, Vista Premium) Black</a>.  You can decide for yourself it it's close to the configuration of your machine.

I've been using McAfee anti-virus protection for a few years now so that was a no-brainer.  But the spyware protection and anti-phishing functions are great.  Total Protection gives me instant validation of some of my spam-related fears, preventing me from letting my curiosity lead me down an internet rabbit hole.

Whereas OneCare could never seem to coexist with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linksys-WRT54GS-Wireless-G-Broadband-Router-with-SpeedBooster/dp/B0001D3K8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster</a>, McAfee practically kissed the router on the cheek and got on with its business.

The first backup that I performed with Total Protection not only went smoothly, but I was able to back up documents, music and a ton of jpeg images to a flash drive with an almost unbelievable compression ratio, leaving plenty of room to spare.  Uh... OneCare not only could back up the same data to that drive, it couldn't allow me to change the destination, hosing up mid-backup.

Another function that seemed to get superior results was in the Registry cleanup.  Keep in mind, I just used OneCare to ""clean"" registry three months ago.  That said, Total Protection found plenty of things to fix and remove, and I have better system performance to show for it.

Last but not least, I like the ability to digitally ""shred"" confidential files.  Any CSI or Law and Order viewer knows that no computer file is ever truly clean of deleted files but with Total Protection I feel much, much more secure.

Bottom line... for me, Microsoft OneCare was definitively NOT the answer.  McAfee Total Protection 2008 DEFINITELY WAS!",0

"You name it, I've seen it in action. From Norton to McAfee, from the FreeAVG to the corporate editions of the various anti-malware/anti-virus suites, I've used them at one stage or another for that's part of my job as a systems manager.

Here's a quick tip: I've found that McAfee's products are better than not having any protection, but be prepared for hassles. My experiences with these anti-virus software has led to me looking at every piece of software with a jaundiced eye. The problems can be many, starting with the overhead of resource usage. Unfortunately, anti-malware/anti-virus software needs to exist, especially for Windows. Unfortunately, the manufacturers have to be very careful so that their software doesn't end up causing problems for the user. A/V has to be like a good butler: there when you need him, and invisible when you don't.
Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 is one of the best in the business. Unlike some of the others I've already mentioned, you're not going to be dealing with flaky, high-minded software. This thing installs within minutes, updates without a hassle, and catches just about everything out there, including the really nasty zero-day stuff.

The interface is a pleasure to work with and on, you're not going to need a four-year-degree to understand what you need to do to protect your computer. The overhead is minuscule. For example, on the computer I'm using right now to type out this review, Kaspersky is currently using 250MB of memory and 0.56% CPU. That's quiet and well-behaved considering everything it's monitoring right this second, about 100 open ports and 172 services and applications.

I have not needed at any time to delve into the firewall for tweaking. I get notified in a discreet manner that doesn't hijack my screen that there's been an exception and also what Kaspersky has decided to do about it. It then allows you the easy option of overriding or amending its actions. It is also easy to modify that action permanently. One of the easiest processes in an anti-malware suite I've ever worked on.

I don't use the Parental Control, but looking over its settings, once again I found the straightforward manipulation on a great user interface. So, for example, once set on a particular account (after setting up a Parent Control password to lock down access), it is possible to lock-down or modify access for everything from filesystem access to web browser and Internet access.

In particular, I really like the applications module where, for the most part, Kaspersky automaticlly sets up what each particular application has access to, from the registry to the Internet/network. Of course, each of these can be changed easily. Applications are also rated on how popular--hence, how safe--they are and in what groups (Trusted or Custom, etc.) they reside. Brilliant piece of work here.

Prepare to be blown away by how tight a grip on the ubiquitous Internet ads there are. Kaspersky effectively shuts down these seemingly stubborn things so that they're literally invisible, even in such applications as you may think can get around it. I have a Twitter application that shows ads in its own window that Kaspersky shut down. Peace!

There is, as usual, an anti-spam component, a wonderfully literate Network Monitor that shows everything your computer is doing, a virtual keyboard--in case you have a hardware snooper installed locally--and something called Safe Run for Websites that sandboxes a browser window so that in that session, you are effectively corralling the visited website from infecting anything on the machine. Splendid stuff.

In short, I am very pleased with how Kaspersky has designed this bit of software. I am giving it my highest possible rating and be assured, I will be buying a renewal once my current subscription of one year runs out.",0

"This program is a great way to learn a language. The method of using pictures with the text helps you make associations and learn much faster and easier than just memorizing words. You do need to be self motivated but I found myself looking forward to the lessons. The program will automatically recommend to repeat a lesson if you make too many errors. I love that you can have up to 5 users so others can learn along with you and that makes it a good value for households that have several members who would like to learn the language. I think it would also be a great family activity and learning with others would be great for motivation and practice. The audio companion CDs are a big help to reinforce and practice what you have learned.

"Purchased by hubby who used it at a power plant to back up systems after we lost TWO hard drives in 2 months.
The beauty of this program is that It creates a true mirror image of one's hard drive.  No reloading of operating system and the crazy license and verification requirements entailed is needed and the file structure is identical to that which existed on the original computer.

I did not have a full-system backup on my laptop which contained 2 accounting packages and the reloading of software and backup files located both on disks and the online backup service was an absolute nightmare.  All of the customization of reports and transaction handling were gone and the programs still are not to my liking.

Worth every penny!",0

"I knew this was just a key card and I had to download it, so I was surprised that it arrived in a ""box"".  The box wasn't that big, and no major harm.

The card gives you a URL to visit to download Office, and then you enter your activation key during installation. The download was easy and activation was easy. I installed this on my 2015 Macbook (Retina) and had no issues with performance or functionality.

My job is 100% using Google collaboration tools, and it's all web based. You'd think that I wouldn't need MS Office anymore, but in fact a lot of stuff still comes in in office format, and it's helpful to have an offline option when I'm traveling or on an airplane where there is no internet.

The nice thing about this package as opposed to a 365 subscription:

1.  It doesn't involve a subscription and doesn't expire
2.  The price is right
3.  Install is simple & straight forward

If your Office needs are pretty basic, this is a good backage to choose and will serve your needs simply.",0
"I always buy H&R Block at the beginning of each year. As I found out H&R Block and Amazon always have a 50% discount at the beginning of each year for this software.

I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 7 schedule K-1 forms from various private placement investments (including 2 oil exploring investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, and a sole proprietorship (for stock trading).  First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)",0
"I'm the CTO of an IT company who uses a mac, but needs Windows.  So I've been using VMware and Parallels alternately for years.  I had most recently been on Parallels 7, and when I upgraded to the Parallels 8 Beta, I had no problems.  No issues.  The migration was fine, and after the upgrade, the VM ran beautifully.  I'm on an SSD so any benefits to the claims of faster booting isn't something I'd really notice, as my system was already booting in less than 15 seconds anyway.  The tools installed fine, dragging and dropping from my physical laptop's desktop to the VM's desktop and vice versa worked great.  Publishing the apps from windows into Mac worked without any hitches as well, but I only did that for testing as I don't run my VM's in that mode - I prefer the windowed mode to keep everything separated.
Only glitch I've hit is one that's been around forever that I've hit in both VMWare and Parallels, and that's the random hiccup with the networking, where it doesn't connect when you have it set to ""default adapter"" and you have to go to the VM tools and force it to use physically the card you're on.  With my previous Macbook Pro it was annoying as I had the gigabit onboard and the wireless, and I changed from one to the other depending on whose network I was on and whether there was wireless available.  But I'm on the new Retina MBP which doesn't have a built in Ethernet, so I can at least leave it set physically to my wireless and be working.  It's easy enough to remember when I pull out the thunderbolt gigabit adapter to change the settings if needed.
All in all, another rock solid product.  If it weren't for that little glitch sometimes with the adapter settings if you're trying to bridge the network, I'd be great.",0

"This is one of their learning heavy games, and I really appreciate that. It still manages to be extremely adventurous even though you're in the downtown of a big city rather than out in a castle, or a haunted mansion. The knowledge gained in this game is interesting, which is what makes the learning worth while. Just make sure you actually have a notebook sitting out to take notes.

My favorite part of this game is it's ending. It's hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen. As a kid, this ending scared me worse than the Ghost Dogs (of Moon Lake) ever could (I should mention that I got into these games just before this and Ghost Dogs was released, and Message in a Haunted Mansion didn't scare me because I -correctly- guessed at what was going on rather early, since I'd seen it so often before on Scooby Doo).

I mark it as my fourth favorite (1. Treasure, 2. Blackmoor, 3. Shadow at Water's Edge, 4. this one, 5. Danger on Deception Island) and I understand why some people might get frustrated and want to put it down. But, unlike many of the games between 11 and 23, at least it doesn't leave people saying 'that's it?' at the end of it.",0

"After using practically every brand of anti-virus software in the past Kaspersky was my choice for an extended period. That changed when I evaluated Bitdefender and found it to be unobtrusive and relatively light on using system resources.  Realistically the basic function of all brands of AV software is the same and they all see-saw in their pros and cons in terms of how they perform that function.  Reading user reviews the one constant is that people just want it to do its job without interfering with the computer's performance or pestering the user with annoying popups and ads.

Unfortunately for Bitdefender, they did not understand their customers and their most recent offering has many negative reviews because of how intrusive it is. So I welcomed the opportunity to go back to Kaspersky and give it a try.

As far as hogging system resources (I have a very fast and powerful system) I would give a slight edge to Kaspersky ... nothing to get excited about but it does seem to tax the system just a little bit less.  As far as ""catching"" potential problems they are probably close to equal, frankly my system isn't exposed to that many threats and the user reports for both brands tend to report the same usual suspects.

As far as just leaving me alone and doing its job, well it appears there is no contest.  So far I have installed and simply forgotten about Kaspersky.  That wasn't true with Bitdefender's latest version.  I can't think of any compelling reason not to choose Kaspersky but if I run into any negatives in the future I will come back and update this review.",0

"This is such a useful software. I used a freeware FastStone Capture, it does a lot of of image captures, editing and adding annotation text. It can do windows, scrolling windows, shapes, etc. Snagit is a much more advanced image and VIDEO capture app. No wonder I have been hearing about it for years on techpodcasts that I listen to. It can capture actual videos including the movement of your mouse cursor which is very useful if you are creating a tutorial/instructional videos. If you are a gamer, and would like to show your exceptional skill to others, you can actually record part of the game and send it to whoever you want to.

There are multiple ways you can do in capturing contents. The software also give you an option to save as personal profiles for different combination of capturing configuration, so you don't have to repeat those mouse clicks that you use the most. Sort of a mini macro.

On capturing text. It can capture text to editable form even on Windows Explorer, WIndows error pop-ups, and more.

Capturing images also give you a built in editor. If you want to annotate an image that you have captured and you don't have enough space to place your text to, you can easily drag the edge of the image and add extra real state on your canvass for your arrows and annotation. You can enhance images by adding edges, shadows, bevels, etc. You can email an authored image with a click of a button.",0

EASIEST ENVELOPE PRINTER I HAVE EVER USED. THANK YOU.,0
"It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support -- Limited PDF support in Home/Student Edition

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  The more expensive version of WordPerfect handles PDF files and will import text and graphic based PDF files and will perform optical character recognition on the PDF file.  As the comment below shows, Corel indicates this version does not open PDF files, although it will publish to PDF.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Although it is not perfect, WordPerfect converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is extremely powerful.  It is just that like most M/S software, it does too much and takes the control away from the user.  It is also unfamiliar to me because the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  Accordingly, I prefer to use WordPerfect and save the output as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph. If you want to change one paragraph, you can do it with a single keystroke (the WordPerfect 6 keystrokes are F4 for left indent or Shift-F4 for double indent).

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] codes and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. For example, once I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!

One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.

As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

Other Programs:

The Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office.  The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning.

"I am a avid photographer with many cameras and photos.  My camera gear is very important to my creative work, and Adobe Creative Cloud is just as important as my other photography gear.  This package is where the magic to great photos take place.

This package is easy to install and have working in a very short time.  There are tons of Youtube videos explaining out best to use this package.  Amazon also has many books to help you learn the best ways to make use of this software.

I highly recommend this product to anyone which to take their photography to new levels.",0
"I made the exact same mistake with version 4.0 that I did with this version.  Because it was the newest/greatest I picked it up as soon as it came out and it proceeded destroy my system.
I use Win98 SE on a 1gig Athlon with a Toshiba CD-ROM and HP CDRW for those who care.  Ever since installing it I have had conflicts with different devices and problems accessing my CD Rom.  The famed ""blue screen of death"" which was almost a distant memory is now returning on a daily basis.  I tried uninstalling 5.0 and reinstalling 4.0 but whatever the program  did is now permanent in my system.  I then reinstalled Win 98 completely and while the conflicts are gone (from a device manager standpoint), the B.S.O.D. still shows up frequently when either my CD-ROM or CDRW is being accessed.  Short of reformatting my hard drive, I don't think I'm going to rid myself of this nuisance.
I was actually pleased with version 4.0 (after about the 3rd or 4th patch), but this is just inexcusable.  Now I understand many Win2000 users are having problems as well.  XP users are having a nightmare - even with the patches!  Please avoid this software and let this company die.  After trying a number of different competitors, I would recommend the much more stable and less bloated Nero for CD Burning.  You can find more info about it at ....",0
"I've used this modem since DSL came out, I still use it.

"I hadn't been aware of BitDefender before being offered the opportunity to review BitDefender Total Security 2009.

  I've used Norton and McAfee and fund plenty to criticize in them. Over the past few years, in fact, my impression is that both brands have become bloated and slow.

  BitDefender is a pleasant surprise. Installation is fast and the installer is well done.

  Funtionally, BitDefender is very smooth. Setup is extremely efficient and the number of intrusive pop-ups is low. Firewall installation is very simple compared to some other packages. BitDefender does an excellent job of recognizing legitimate applications and letting their traffic pass through.

  The range of services is impressive, though some of them such as IM Encryption would appear to be of dubious value in the real world.

  The BitDefender CD is bootable (it runs under Knoppix Linux, a very dependable distribution) and can be used to ""analyze/repair/disinfect"" a compromised system.

  The feature list of BitDefender Total Security 2009 is long - 22 by BitDefender's count. The important functions seem to be well regarded. BitDefender came out on top in an allegedly independent test of antivirus detection.

  It will take me a while to assess the value of AES encrypted storage capabilities (great if it works); a gamer mode that limits security during online gameplay (unlikely something I'll ever use, but very valuable to families with online gamers), local network management (appears to be somewhat limited compared to other products); online backup, privacy protection and so on.

  One quality that is high on my list is antivirus scanning speed and overhead. On this one factor, BitDefender is a clear winner. It scans at an impressively high speed and doesn't bog down the system as Norton and McAfee do. On one Norton equipped computer where I have the antivirus scan set for late evening, it often starts while I am still working. Nine times out of ten, I'll shut Norton down because it is such a resource hog.

  Not so with BitDefender.

  Overall, BitDefender Total Security 2009 is a very impressive package in terms of capabilities and price. If it holds up under continuous use and scrutiny, I can see it (happily) as a replacement for Norton and McAffee, Well worth checking out in your own environment.

"Corel PaintShop is a pleasant surprise.  I take a lot of pictures on vacations and most of them are pretty easy to clean up. The ones that give me the most trouble are from our scuba diving trips. Close ups are usually ok, but taking landscapes and pictures of my wife usually end up looking like I took them with a blue filter on the camera or they are just really washed out. Using White Balance really helps clean them up fast.  As an armature photographer I think this is much easier to use than Photoshop, and has all the power I need.  All in all it is a great software package.",0

I'd highly recommend it for a non-expert like me who wants something that works without needing an advanced degree. But photo mavens won't be disappointed, either.

"I've long looked to Ulead VideoStudio as the best amateur video editing software out there, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to compare this package to those I've used in the past, namely the ubiquitous Windows Movie Maker and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roxio-Easy-Media-Creator-Suite-10/dp/B000UJUJ7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10</a>.  I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.

It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.

The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one ""audio"" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.

VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.

As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.

The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package.",0
"Sage 50 Pro is full features business accounting software competing with QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks  Premiere.  This software is aimed at small to medium size businesses.  Sage 50 Premiere has the complete set of features and is similar to Quickbooks Premiere.  These 2 are for medium to large size business and also companies running more accounts, reports, etc. Other options like Sage Peachtree and Quickbooks Online are for personal accounting and small business without payroll.

I have tried Quickbooks Online 4 years ago (and tested PeachTree), when looking for accounting software for my 2 employee S-Corp.  I thought I could save some money.  Within 2 months I met all the limitations and upgraded to Quickbooks Pro.  At the time QB Pro was the best option and Sage 50 didn't establish it's reputation.  Spending $200 a year on Quickbooks QUICKLY added up to over $300 a year - once I purchased the upgrades NEEDED to use the features.  This upset me.  Just give me the full software up front!

I was given a copy of Sage 50 Pro to test with Amazon Vine and I am now in the process of switching everything over from QuickBooks.  I feel that both software are very similar, offer the same features, and are too close to say one is better than the other.  Ultimately it's personal opinion.  To me, saving a few hundred each year is worth is.

In the month I've been using it, I found the menu system easy to navigate and all the reports very helpful.  This is top rate software and its shows.  In the next month I plan on making the full switch.  Importing my data to Sage was as easy an selecting ""import"" and letting the software go to work.  In the next few weeks I'll phase over completely and update my review.  I don't expect any problems.",0

"As a Vista-fugue, the main reasons for even bothering with a `Bootcamp' Windows installation were Microsoft ""Office"" and Intuit's ""Quicken/Turbotax"", both richer-featured in their PC than in their Mac releases.  Disappointingly, iWork '08 'Pages' performed better as an image-based page layout package for the multimedia center crowd, proving woefully underpowered in a professional business office ... crippled by the tediously awkward conversion hassle from  *.doc to  *.pages documents.

I was so impressed with the new Pages (as against the flashy eye candy of the '08 version) that I ordered the full boxed version.  [The trial software is well worth a test run to see if iWork meets your needs.)  The new Pages now easily exports a document in doc, txt or pdf format, and does a remarkably lifelike transformation of even highly complex Word documents, tables, lists, or legal briefs with a mere double-click or drag-and drop.

Rather than spreading myself too thin, I limit this review to `Pages', leaving commentary on `Numbers' to spreadsheet buffs ... `Numbers' capabilities, in the past, were no match for the depth of MS-Excel.  If  `Numbers`  performs as well as  `Pages'  in this  iWork  overhaul, then the product will be the best eighty bucks gift for your Mac.  `Keynote', an image-with-outline presenter's tool, probably will prove at least the equal of MS-PowerPoint considering the Mac's flair for spectacular graphics.

`Pages' well may be the impressive turnaround software that elevates the Mac from multimedia center toy to serious professional business status.  Highly recommended for Vista-weary PC users and Mac loyalists looking for a solid business suite.  The detailed crystal-clear manuals and crisp `Help' replies are welcome value-added resources.",1
"Pinnacle Studio was the video editing software suite I first tried and learned on... back in like version 8 or something like that--it was 10-15 years ago.  Anyway, nobody showed me how to do anything related to video editing and I was really starting from square one on my own.  It took a bit of time, but simply by playing around with it a bit, I figured out how to do most things I could think to want to do.  The interface made sense and their documentation was sufficient for me to learn by playing.

Back then, Pinnacle was pretty buggy.  Several times I would want to throw something at my computer because the program would crash and lose the last hour of my work.  That was a big deal, however, everything else about Pinnacle made me very happy.  Since then, I've tried my hand at several other video editing suites including (and I don't even know if some of these are around anymore) Roxio Video Wave, Cyberlink Power Director, Corel Video studio, Ulead Video Studio, and even Adobe Premier Pro.  There are pluses and minuses on most of them (I say ""most"" because some are all ""minus"" and no ""plus"").  For example, while Adobe Premier Pro is super powerful, I can never figure out how to do what I want to do on it (not to mention it is super expensive if you don't know somebody who works for Adobe and can get it for you for like 10% of the original cost).

So, what is a budding video editor to do?  What suite should they buy?

I still love Pinnacle Studio and from my experience (not that I do this every day or anything), they have really polished their software and it is not buggy like the old versions used to be.  If you choose this suite, you'll be able to do most anything you want.  As a side note, I also really enjoy using PowerDirector for the same reasons--powerful and easy to use.  However, this version of Pinnacle Studio comes with a bonus that I got excited about: live screen captures!  There have been many times I've wanted to be able to record what I was doing on screen, but when last I seriously looked into it (a while ago, I admit) all the software to do it was expensive and I didn't want to spend money on it.  Now I get it as a free bonus to an already great program.

Also
I was sad to learn a few years ago that Corel bought Pinnacle.  I'm not a fan of Corel, primarily because I don't like their tendency to use the Protexis licensing service due to the fact that I have noticed system stability issues from it (Corel Video Studio lived on my computer for about 1 day before I uninstalled it and threw it out).  This is why I was thrilled to learn that even though Pinnacle is owned by Corel, it did not install Protexis.  YAY!

As I continue to use Pinnacle Studio 18, I'll update if I find any issues, but so far I'm very happy with it.

"I've used iMovie for some time.  You can manipulate sound, frames, etc...  Add effects, etc...  With this program you can do that and more.  The nice thing is it isn't too challenging to go that.  I was nervous at first when I first started using it.  However, they've made it pretty easy unless you're a real novice and are all thumbs when it comes to computers.  Yes, it's a hefty price but well worth it.  You can make Holly-wood type movies for a fraction of the price of some of the other editing software out there.",0
My Dell 1905FP is an excellent LCD monitor.  The default ICM profile made it appear a bit too bright and/or harsh but the color was fine.  After calibrating it with this it looks MUCH better.  Colors appear natural and in the correct balance.  I now make prints that are very close to matching what I see on the monitor whereas before it was pretty much a trial and error process.  Highly recommended for digital photographers.,0

"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product.",0
"I just switched to an iMac after using PC's for many years, and VMware's Fusion has been a huge convenience for me. I have a few Windows applications (Quicken, Outlook for it's task functionality) for which I can't find acceptable Mac counterparts. Fusion allows you to run a fully functional Windows instance on the Mac, and it does so seamlessly. I actually run my Windows instance on a separate monitor, giving me access to fully functional Mac and Windows apps from one computer.

It seems that the Windows applications run a bit slower than they would on a native Windows computer, but not enough to be an inconvenience to me. I'm very happy with this purchase and would be using two separate computers if it weren't for Fusion.",0
"I have been using Intuit's Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my taxes for many years. I like the way it defines what you need to enter, provides explanations on each and every item and provides recommendations based on the data you enter.

"I must confess that I am one of those Moms that constantly ask the kids to show me how to do something again. On a side note I am nottechnologically challenged but mainly someone that does not have the patience to read through manuals just to accomplish one item. So this was a huge relief that it was really easy to set up and very user friendly. I love that that there are five sections Library, Adjustment, Edit, Slideshow and Print. This helped me into organizing my photos in a very friendly manner. The program was easy to install and in the event you cannotfind the user manual there is a help button on the screen so you can access it quickly and find what you are looking for. If you are me and have stopped procrastinating to finally organize the family photos, you will not be dissapointed with the Cyberlink and you won't have to bother your kids again. I loved it!",0
"Roxio has been the Classique audio as well as video, editor that excels at its tasks in so many respects. Since version 4 even the basic editing features have been the bte
noire of this classic program. Up until versions 11 and 12 it appeared that the makers of Roxio Creator have played around with the configuration of this excellent product
sometimes to its own detriment. The current owners Corel have packaged Creator NXT with paint shop Pro making this an invaluable purchase for anyone wanting to edit pictures
video and audio.
 The structure of the software follows the traditional format that Roxio has always done which is to base the home tab with all of the capabilities. I found that this
was a good way to start, and an easy way to incorporate the new elements; Corel has obviously learned from some classic software blunders and they have kept the essential
structure of a great program. The picture capabilities as well as the video capabilities are very advanced. I easily found the classic capabilities of editing photos, editing
videos, and many parts of the program that I've used in versions up to seven and eight of Roxio Creator. As someone coming from the older version where Roxio did primarily
audio tasks and a collection of video tasks, the additional capabilities take a little getting used to but in the format that Roxio works virtually all of the tasks can be
picked up easily, either through general use or the help section they call the learning Center. The additional capabilities look very similar to some of the Avid software that
I have used, but they have the generally easier format which Roxio brings to the party. Special mention to the CD and audio creation section, which has some excellent
capabilities: one great advantage in the audio section is the ability to turn vinyl into excellent digital files, and you can do that with a Roxio product all with some
general cables that you can get at Amazon. As the case in the audio section, the ability to process and enhance audio files is superb. The disc burning section is fully
compatible with CD, DVD, Blu-ray in all respects: the tasks it can perform I once again high-value, but they have that same Roxio ease of use.
 I'm not a big fan of their card, poster, ""Hallmark moments"" type of cards, calendars, however you can take pictures of any kind, edit them for maximum effect, even
brush up old and damaged pictures, to make some eye-popping pictures and calendars.
 Whilst I have found Roxio NXT to be generally useful and thoroughly amazing, in-line with my previous experience with Roxio, my main suggestion about service and
support is that if you want to do something do NOT call the so-called help and service number, what some people used to call product support for Roxio. I attempted to use the
convert file to video DVD function and found that I had to call the support number, or should I say email ultimately, since the product support numbers require a convoluted
series of numbers just to get you to the starting point where they will refer you to a useless webpage. About the best thing I can suggest with the copy and convert section is
that you look up in the learning Center to find out what can be converted to the main type of files. The main issue I have with support is that the MP4 file I wanted to
convert was all I was asking about, and it took days for support to work out that my question which I repeated in each email was something that the convert subprogram did not
do. This is not a big issue when you consider just how many types of files that Roxio NXT can deal with, and it is quite a lot, but I really got to the point that I felt the
so-called support technicians did not know their product. Anyway, my verdict is that the program is excellent, it does an amazing variety of tasks and it has that classic
Roxio ease of use: and if you really want to it has a very easy to use interface with the cloud, not that I'm recommending use the cloud :-).",0

"Having to comb through multiple records and screens, and even different programs to get up to date when a customer calls is cumbersome in the older versions. I would often let the answering machine take the call and then I would return it once I was able to bring up the customers history including emails. Now it is all integrated into QuickBooks; smart move Intuit.

Of course they are in to it to make money. (No pun intended) so payroll now includes paying only 1 employee instead of 3 like it used to. It is now $2 per employee, per month for each additional employee. However that is a lot cheaper than a payroll service.

For those who are angry at Intuit for the challenges of setting up the installation, all I can say is what else is there? Hey I get frustrated like the next guy but I have been using Intuit products since their inception. (I am an old late 80s DOS guy to start) They have always been way ahead of the curve in making easy to use intuitive products; hence the name Intuit. I was frustrated with Qbooks 2013 in the colors they chose to display. It was hard on the eyes, next to 2010, but then they corrected that pretty much with an update.

I love QuickBooks. I have been running my company with 2010 QB Pro and there isn't anything I don't love about it. I could get critical and say when I am sending a customer an email it locks me out of being able to go anywhere else other than that window. That is one of the advantages of 2014 thanks to its greatly enhanced email functions.

QB 2014 also sports a calendar with reminders. I often use my tasks option in Outlook for running my business. So doing this in QuickBooks will seem like second nature to me.

QuickBooks in years past kept me so organized that when I got into a dispute with a business associate over some numbers he was blown away at how easily I could provide reports that substantiated everything I was saying. Consequently I got paid for what we agreed I would be paid for.

One important tip is that if you are running more than one business you may want to keep your old version as well. Be sure and back up your company files before loading a new version. When loading any new version of QuickBooks it asks you if you would like to keep the old version, or overwrite it. I keep the old version AND I choose not to have my company file updated to the new version. That way I can keep two versions of QuickBooks open at the same time. It is tedious to have to close one company, and open another every time a customer has a question. So by having two versions running concurrently, you can click on either tab and have instant access. You also can have one version running on one machine, and another version running on another if you have more than one person in the office, and each one assigned to a different company. It saves money that way not having to pay for two new versions when the old one works fine.",0

"I have used Turbo tax for years and during that time I have also tried other products H+R, Jackson, blahblahblah.

In the nutshell, this will get your taxes done quickly with the right forms and get you all set for your taxes.  Those of you who like to be ""creative"" with your taxes this will also tell you how much BS your filing and your chances of being audited.  The one thing I have noticed is that not all software can handle the states very well, people have complained about their state taxes being hosed somewhat.

Overall I give this a 5 star considering I could take my personal papers to a CPA, tax preparer, or try to hammer it out myself.  It cuts the time down to nothing, 2 hours and I'm done.

"The Norton 360 (N360) security suite was installed on the Dell XPS desktop (Windows 7 64-bit) in my study a week ago.  It replaced the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVG-Internet-Security-2011-3-User-Old-Version/dp/B003WT1KFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVG Internet Security 2011 (3-User) [Old Version</a>](IS2011)that I've used for one year trial.  The AVG IS2011 started out as a fast and efficient security suite but got bogged down more and more after each Windows update; startups (with automatic definition updates) and shutdowns became tiresome process taking 2-3minutes (keeping computer offline when not in use decrease chances for intrusions); system scans were very slow: taking 3 hours or more;  computer locked on occasion while browsing; however, IS2011 did catch two trojans and provided solid protection from cyber threats.

Likes:
The N360 was easy to install but did require a 146MB download for the initial update.  User interface easy to understand and navigate for specific settings.  All security functions were set and ready to roll after the install.  Especially helpful was the included PC Tuneup that tunes up the PC automatically; I went ahead and performed the Registry Cleanup which was fast and easy: 214 unnecessary Registry entries were deleted and my PC became more responsive.  It also automatically detected and deleted more than 18GB of Temporary Internet Files (that were hidden and not deleted with the standard delete function in Internet Options.) Fast startups (90s) and shutdowns (7s).  Doesn't seem to hog system resources like previous versions of Norton and other brands like AVG and Bitdefender.

Dislikes:
None so far but I'm going to wait and see if future Windows critical updates will create conflicts/slowdowns with N360.

Overall:
It's too early to conclude on the effectiveness and efficiency of N360 but my criteria for easy installation, easy setup and use, non-intrusive protection in background, low usage of system resources, bonuses of PC Tuneup and Online ID protection have been met.",1
"...and all I can base my review on is my own experience with the product. Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

"You should ask yourself - ""how can a piece of software be capable of generating so much hostility from its user base?"" If you can't think up a good answer, go ahead and install Quicken, and you'll have an answer before long.

Some of my favorite quirks from Quicken 2006 & 2007 that I'm glad to see survived the upgrade to Quicken 2008:

Basic arithmetic errors: sometimes, if you edit transactions in the register, every subsequent transaction will get confused about the running total (e.g., change a $10 debit to a $20 debit, and instead of changing the running total by $10, watch in delight and amazement as the running total leaps by thousands, literally thousands, of dollars).

Basic reporting errors: go ahead and open the category list, and click the (very unintuitive) button to generate a report for the category _DivInc. If, like me, you have several years of investment transactions, you're sure to have dividend income, but Quicken will tell you ""no transactions for this category."" Funny, if you type _DivInc into the global search window, it will bring up all those transactions the report couldn't locate.

File corruption: sometimes, I like to imagine Quicken's routines as a bunch of angry little gnomes running around the traces of my processor and through the registers of my memory. This is because, every so often, the gnomes demand a sacrifice, and offer up burnt offerings of your data integrity to their terrible god of woe. I can't otherwise imagine how downloading QFX data from Hewitt Associates confused Quicken so - in the online center, it shows ""number of outstanding transactions: -65,536"" Yep, negative 2 to the 16th power of transactions outstanding.

Probably the worst part about Quicken, however, is trying to free your data. If you've got any kind of complicated financial picture (i.e, if you're over 25 years old), you won't be able to free yourself from Quicken's grasp, since the only way to get data out of the program is in QIF format, one measly account at a time. Funny, they don't support _importing_ QIFs, claiming, and I quote, ""QIF technology is over 10 years old and was designed for technical support purposes . . . QIF Data Import requires many steps to download, is a poor customer experience and can lead to duplicate transactions and errors."" That old technology is good enough for you should you dare to _export_ data from Quicken, however. They're going to make darn sure that you have a ""poor customer experience"" and suffer from ""duplicate transactions and errors"" if you try to take your data anywhere else.",1
"It seemed like for a while Kaspersky's protection was starting to lack but it seems like it has improved and provides solid protection from spam and malware.

"I gave Acronis 2011 five stars because it did what I needed it to do (and thankfully never gave me any issues).

I really like this software.  It's very easy to use and very fast.  I recognize the need for keeping your hard drive clean for more efficient use and in the past have used several producst to do this.  WinCleaner allows me to do all that with just one product.  After you install it you can configure it to do what you want it to do.  From that point forward you just have to remember to click one button to run the software.  Works beautifully and keeps my 4 year hard drive running smoothly.,0
"We can't all afford over $1000 for Final Cut or Adobe products. With Video Studio X6, Corel continues to offer a full featured video editing suite for an amazing price. For the vast, vast majority of users this software will be sufficient for video editing. I think this program is a great place to start for any beginner or intermediate level editor. You can always upgrade to Final Cut or Adobe later if your needs outstrip this software. In the meantime, this is a full featured program for a great price and I couldn't recommend it more.",0

"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""

I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. The Federal portion of these two packages is identical, so I am cross posting my review of the Federal portion of the software for both packages .

H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal e-files. You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"I have been an avid user/teacher of Chief Architect Inc software since 1995 (I mainly use Chief Architect X1 in my /drafting and design business) but the line of consumer software like Home Designer Pro 8 is a great way to introduce yourself to professional level output. Yes it is a cut-down version in terms of choices and productivity tools that are available in its ""Big Brother"" (Chief X1) but at 1/5 th the price it makes up for the extra steps its economy warrants. The only thing that is more difficult to do in Pro than Chief X1 is curved roof planes, other than that it can easily do what programs costing many thousands more can do.

"If you can't afford a Router (hardware) then use this software instead.

Although MSWIN XP has its own Firewall you would do better to turn it off, go to the `Zonelabs' website, download the Free version of Zonealarm, install it and give it a go. Study it for an evening and see how many access attempts there are on your computer. I promise - you will never go back from using this great firewall. Go to the Gibson Research Corporation on the internet and test your systems vulnerability using the software on that site - all free. Now if you want to make the next leap by having a more sophisticated version of Zonealarm then go Pro with this one. The pro version offers the following additions to the free version.

- An improved approval program for Internet Access.

- Advanced security controls.

- Automatically stops pop-up ads so you can surf in peace.

- Prevents personal data from leaving your computer without permission.

- Checks for and deletes adware cookies.

- Blocks adware cookies but allows cookies from trusted sites.

- Protects your privacy and improves PC performance.

- Tracks hacker attempts and anonymously reports offenders to their ISPs.

- Monitors outgoing email and halts messages with potential viruses.

Now as an all in one tool you could also opt for the ZoneAlarm Security Suite that gives you an anti-virus program to top it all off, so as an all in one security system this really is a great solution for the home user. If you stick with the free version make sure to also use adaware and AVG, both free anti-ad/anti-virus software packages that help complement the free version but the all in one Security Suite is still you best buy.

In Short, this is an essential security product.",0
"This is about as perfect as it gets. This is my second year using this software (as opposed to QuickBooks). I loved it the first year I used it and continue to feel likewise with this newest version. I like this version a bit more than the premium version since it's less expensive and still includes everything our family business requires. That's something to consider when deciding between versions.

It is a snap to install, seems ""bug"" free (at least as of right now and following some pretty serious use), and it is incredibly intuitive/easy to use. In fact, the ease of this program is a time-saver for me ... and that means more time with me family. And, that is invaluable!

This is expertly developed, phenomenally well-tested, and worth every penny!

Bravo to Sage for making a product that consumers can truly invest their trust in!",0

"I bought Microsoft Office 2007 Professional Academic version because I was (and still am) a struggling (with illnesses mostly) college student, and then I took a chance on the Office 2007 Ultimate Steal Microsoft was running. But I realized I needed more than just 2 PCs to read .docx, .pptx, and .xlsx files on, and this proved to be just the ticket. I could evaluate the new versions of the three most commonly used (for me at least) Office programs on 3 computers.

I have it installed on one nearly brand new PC as of right now; but I will eventually install it onto the rest of the eligible PCs if not indeed buy new systems just for this version of Office. I like what I see from Office 2010. It matches the interface of the Windows Live applications, WordPad, and Paint; which the color scheme chosen for 2007 prevented it from doing. I hope to eventually upgtade my everyday school laptop to one with a new-fangled processor, and the 3-install disc will come in very handy.

I got the last copy of this software available at my local Wal-Mart, and it has proven that you don't have to have the highest-end Office suite to be able to get productive work done, whether for school assignmnents or personal use.

I know Office 2003 is better, but my school has long since switched to 2007 and now 2010, so I had to get with it, and not keep using something so outdated on PCs that I hope to earn my college degree with.

In summation, I am keeping Office 2007 Professional and Ultimate around for tasks requiring off-the-wall Office applications, but my daily driver wersion of Office will become 2010, despite the fact I feel like it's 2007 with a new coat of paint.",0
"I just bought another copy of the ""older"" N360 2013 for the new registation Key, but I've been running this newer ""2014"" version for a few months already. Norton has the nice feature of alway being able to upgrade to the latest version as long as your subcription is still current. I have a little over 2 months left on my current N360 subscription and saw the 2013 version available a  nice price here on Amazon, so I bought another 3PC one user box. I have to wait untill my current subscription expires or a day or so untill it does to enter the new KEY, because if I did it now, I would lose the remainder of my current subscription.

OK, I've said enough that is not really review material, but should be useful to anybody using Norton.
Review-wise, I think Norton 360 is a great product and works well for me. The only issue I have with it is the stupid cloud based  (these days) password ""vault"". I preferred the older, local  password manager, which on one of my PC's, is the way I still have it set up. I made the mistake of logging onto Symantec one day with my user ID and password, and it kind of ""Grabbed"" my password manager and made it the cloud based vault thing, which sounded OK, but when I logged into it with my Laptop, which had fewer log-ins and passwords, it for some crazy reason synched the cloud data FROM my laptop. When I used my desktop next time, the Cloud password data got synched TO my desktop and I lost 3/4 of my log ins and passwords. Fortunately, I back up my passwords to a local hardrive file with a built in, but awkward to find utility in Norton to import or export, and I was able to get it all back.
Other than that quirk. I like the software a while lot. It runs smotthly, and does not cause my PC's to crash. That IS pretty bad, but I was able to recover.",0
"Item: WordPerfect Office X7 Standard version.
This software is a great alternative to Microsoft Office WORD. I've used versions of Corel's WordPerfect many times in the past. I've mainly worked with MS Word the last few years because it's commonly used in the workplace. But after using this new version of WordPerfect, I really enjoyed working with Corel's new WordPerfect version. I'm running this software on a Windows 8.1 machine with 12 GB of RAM. In addition to WordPerfect, you get Roxio Secure Burn and additional clipart, photos, and a PDF catalog of fonts. The installation took about 3 minutes to install WP, about 1 minute for Roxio, and 1 minute for the clipart and fonts.

Components: WordPerfect (like MS Word, a word-processing program), Quattro Pro (like Excel, spreadsheets), Presentations (like Powerpoint, presentations), and WP Lightning which allows note-taking, viewing WPD's (WordPerfect Documents) and MS Word files.
You can also search within WP Office files by installing one of the features (set to install by default).

Interface: It's a clean interface. Everything is easy to find. It's the same old similar interface from years before, not like the ribbon interface of the new MS Office. Everything works smoothly, from viewing, editing, and publishing PDF's to mail merges. You can also create XML documents. Having the ability to import PDF's and have them converted into editable documents is a great feature. Then you can publish documents into the PDF format.

Reliability: All three program ran flawlessly. Each one is just slightly different than its MS Office counterpart, so there is a small learning curve, but these programs are excellent for accomplishing everything that the MS Office programs can do.

Features: Built-in PDF tools (this is very helpful), dual-monitor support, Create fillable PDF forms, enhanced Mail Merge Expert. Also included is Roxio Secure Burn which is a CD/DVD/Blu-ray burning software. The Roxio software functions very well and without errors.

System Requirements: Preferably you want to use Windows 8/8.1, or Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit). You can use Win XP (32-bit), but don't expect it to run smoothly as it would on 7 or 8/8.1. You also should have at least 1 GB of RAM to run smoothly. It says only 256 MB is required, but most computers nowadays should have 1 GB minimum anyway. You don't want these programs dragging.",0

"Let me start by saying, I've used TurboTax for years.  It has always made my doing my taxes for myself possible without paying an accountant or going to one of the name brand tax preparing offices.

They have made some changes this year and or cut backs depending on how you look at it.  It appears almost anything you would need (forms) to deal with being a small business owner or being self employed is only available in this version, not a lesser version like deluxe, etc. So, if you are self employed and want to do your own taxes, this is the version for you.  It will walk you thru or allow you to fly on your own, but either way - it guarantees the calculations, etc. and so far has never let me down.  I highly recommend it for the do it yourselfers.",0

"When Mac introduced Intel chips they opened the door to finally be able to run PC software on the Mac.  I rushed out and bought Parallels.  When Parallels was the only game in town it was great.  Sure Parallels crashed sometimes, and would often lose its internet connection.  But it was great to be able to run PC's.

Now you have an established visualization leader, VMWare in the game.  I've rarely seen VMWare crash or drop its internet connection.  You're still not going to run 3d windows games at full power/extreme performance.  But for everything short of video games, this product does quite well.

VMWare lets me use hardware that just does not support my Mac.  I can plug in my TomTom, programmable remote control, Lego Mindstorms and other USB devices that do not have Mac programs.  Or in the case of Mindstorms, do not have a very good Mac program!

If you want the best of both worlds, this is a great product!",0
"Gave it 5 stars because I've not found a reason to give it less.  I've used McAfee for years.  I especially like the Quick Clean feature that cleans up my computer's unnecessary temporary files along with clearing the cache and history and other things that take up space and can slow down a computer.

I was hesitant this time when I bought it though, because it was for a download with a subscription code card number.  I've always used a CD for the install in prior years.  When I recently bought a new laptop, I separately bought an external disc drive since my laptop doesn't contain one.  Who knew that things I used to install via a CD are pretty much now only offered as downloads, online.  This is one of those things.  I was nervous trying a new way to install my McAfee Internet Security but I worried needlessly.  It was quite easy and I didn't run into any problems whatsoever.  The product works as it should and like I expected it to.

I do want to mention that I think some people said if you already have a subscription to McAfee, when you install a new version, it extends your subscription for another year from the end date of your old subscription.  I didn't find that to be true.  My previous subscription, that came with my new laptop, was due to run out on (not sure of the date now), let's say, 3/26.  I installed the new subscription on 3/24/2014.  It didn't extend my subscription to 3/26/2015.  Instead, it subscribed me from the date of installation, 3/24 for one year, to 3/24/2015.  So, if you still have a week or two left on your current subscription, I would advise not installing the new one before then.  It's not the worst thing in the world but, it appears you will then lose that week or two that were still remaining on your old subscription.

I do not find that my computer slows down at all on my new laptop.  On my much older PC that runs Vista, there is a noticeable slow down when McAfee is scanning of updating while I'm using the computer.  But, that computer is slow even when nothing is happening to interfere with its performance so I guess Anything that's running in the background would make it operate even slower.  On my laptop that runs Windows 8.1, I find no problem whatsoever.  I've been warned, over the years, not to open certain links or websites and because of McAfee, I've never had a virus, thank goodness.",0
"I bought it two month ago, my modem and router are like 50 yards away from my bedroom, I was trying to get some internet access while I was watching tv or looking over my child, it was impossible not only for the distance, it was also for the material of the walls of the house, it is some kind of hard concrete that blocks away any type of signals, even 900 mhz frecuency from my wireless phones. I tried getting out the wireless router and aim it to the room, it did not work. I tried buying a wireless signal extender, did not work eather, I tried buying an extra large antenna that comes with a long cable, I hooked it to my router and put it rigth in the hallway aiming directly to my bedroom, it showed some signal but poorly enough to not be accesible. I was comited to find the solution and while I was searching around the internet I found this product. dessperate as I was I decided to try it even if I did not have any prior reference of it. I came home, hooked it and it has not stopped working since. I recomended it widely, easy to set up and noiseless.

"The Corel Suite X4 Installed on my Windows XP Pro system with Service Pack 2 without any problems.  Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.

The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.",0

"This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon.

To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0

"Cyberlink PowerDirector 13 Ultimate

Let me start out by saying there are many high quality Video Editing software out there that offer a lot of high tech effects, lots features that take many weeks or months of continue use to master, but one of the most important features to me must be that Ease of Use feature.

I don't have a degree in video editing, I just want a fairly simple program that offers many features that don't require vast knowledge of rocket science to operate. In this Cyberlink PowerDirector, I think I found one.

The process is simple and to the point, Capture, Edit, Produce and Create a Disk. This program was the simplest I've ever was able to capture video without a bunch of hoopla, especially from my Canon VIXTA Mini X. Once captured, editing was easy so far as all I wanted to do was clean up my video of my new grandchildren, edit out the different pauses and rearrange some of the sequences before copying to several disks to share with other family members.

Another feature was how easy it was to change the format and how quickly the Rendering process was. You know, isn't the usual long time it takes for a project to render a real deal breaker. This program is three times as fast as the others I've used and own.

And because this is the Ultimate version, it came with several add-ons that offer many different approaches to video editing like CyberLinks newest version of WaveEditor 2 for that awesome sound effects, Holiday and Wedding effects and what seems to be an endless array of special effects and adjustments. And although having the ability to view actual 4K is limited and still priced very high, this software has you covered for that also.

Am I an expert using CyberLink's newest video editing software, not quite, but so far I am finding it to be the easiest software of this type to master. Along with my new video camera, his software and the several holidays just around the corner, I am looking forward to making some awesome videos.",0
"I've tried numerous anti-virus and Internet Security products and have come back to Kaspersky again and again.  I tried Kaspersky Pure as well but it was difficult to remove when I decided to use Internet Security the next year.  I understand that the difference between Kaspersky Anti-Virus and Internet Security is that the latter has a second firewall.  I do not notice performance issues using the Internet Security, so I'll stick with it.  Be prepared for numerous banner alerts weeks before your version will expire, which is annoying, but I suppose other anti-virus and Internet Security makers do this as well.

My daughter accidentally downloaded some malware one day (clicking on ""your computer is infected"" links from a compromised website) and Kaspersky emailed me instructions on its removal.  As long as your software is up to date, Kaspersky has a help line and great insight for ascertaining what has infected your computer as well as detailed and easy to follow instructions to eradicate it.  Highly recommended!",0

"Yet another great Nancy Drew game!

In ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"", Nancy is hired to help renovate an old victorian house, as the owners are hoping to turn it into a bed & breakfast.

Upon her arrival, Nancy finds out that a lot of strange things & accidents have been occuring at the home - ever since they began the renovations...  Is a ghost behind it all - as one of the owners believes, or is one of the hired help or even one of the owners to blame for all that's going on?  And if it's one of ""the living"", what reason do they have to cause all of this havoc?  Your job as Nancy Drew, teen detective will be to answer these questions, and get to the bottom of it.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew series.  I am 36 years old, and still love playing these games - a testament to the fact that they are appropriate for pre-teen, teen & adults alike!",0

"Bought this card to augment the number of Firewire ports in my new MacPro (only design flaw I find in that computer...not enough Firewire inputs for professional use). It replaced the first Sonnet card I bought as that one (a combo USB/Firewire card) didn't play well with my computer for what I needed (word to wise - before buying a PCI card make sure that your peripherals will work with it. Firebox, for instance, needs a specific chipset and Firewire only cards to work...something buried on their website).

Card installed easily and has worked beautifully with no problems.

"This product makes doing our taxes very easy!  I don't know if we would have saved more by going to a tax preparer, but our taxes are not complicated!",0
"I'm very pleased with the size and quality of the product.  It's tiny, with just enough of the unit exposed so that it can be easily grasped and removed.  It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

I'm really glad that I bought it based both on the performance & the fact that it was a third of the cost of similar items sold in local stores.",0
"I have children 14, 11, and 9, and I was looking for software that would appeal to their creative side.  I am a fairly sophisticated software user, and used to do some programming myself, but had never really ventured into these type of painting/art programs.

Bottom Line: I was blown away by this program, totally impressed!!

Why?

#1 It's easy to use out of the box--- many of the controls are easy enough to figure out just by using them, it installs easy on both Mac and PC systems (I installed the program on both an old eMac and a low end Vista laptop successfully).

#2 It's really powerful--- once you really get into the software, it's amazing all the different brushes and textures and effects that you can do to make really impressive art.

#3 The tutorials are first rate--- A thick instruction manual that actually is well written, and actually teaches you about basic principles of art and painting.  There are also a whole series of video tutorials included free.  You can tell that a lot of hard work and frankly a lot of love went into this, which is a rarity for computer software these days.

#4 It's a great value--- For all you get, the price is very reasonable.  And check the company's website, if you're still not sold they were at the time of this writing offering a 60 day free downloadable trial.

One more tip:  Get even a low-price graphics tablet to go along with the software--- you'll be glad you did!",0

Wonderful! Just what is needed for everyday computer work!,0
"If there is one reason why I like this product, it is the simplistic rating that they provide to each and every website even before you visit that website.  Let us say for example that you visit [...] and search for 'LCD HDTV' - google comes back with thousand of results - we all know that some of these sites are genuine and some of them are just spam sites which are there just to introduce virus into our computer and hack information from us.

McAfee does a good job of highlighting each of the google results links with a easy to see marking if that site is safe to visit - this will result in avoiding a lot of bad websites and harm to our computeers.

There are a couple of other good things about McAfee:
  * Comprehensive protection - McAfee protects not just against viruses, but also against Spamware
  * On access scan - This is something which you will hate as well as equally like :  The Antivirus will always keep running in the background and scan each and every website you visit, each and every program you run.  This will slow down things a little bit, but the protection is comprehensive.

  I have noticed that McShield much faster than Symantic in On-Access scanning
  * Easy to share : A 3-user license is very easy to share, you get to create an online account with McAfee with which you can download the latest version of antivirus on any computer and install it",0
"The software installed and worked well on a Windows 8 64 bit system.  It is designed in a logical well thought out way.  The program was very easy to learn and to use.  The software is very comprehensive and provides a huge number of features.  Lots of power for the price.  One thing I especially appreciate about Corel products is that they have been very good about correcting any bugs promptly through service releases.

Excellent value and highly recommended.",0

"My personal favorite these days.

 I have Adobe Creative Suite and know my way around Adobe Premiere and AfterEffects.

 But the reality is that most of my video editing needs are light-weight ad don't require the power of those two programs.

 I have used Adobe Premiere Elements (an excellent program) and Magix Movie Edit Pro (which has never had a stable version) and the execrable Pinnacle (awful no matter who owned the company, Avid being the absolute worst). Buy Cyberlink PowerDirector after years of constant refinement is now the best in class.

 They boast of dozens of main features, most of which like faux 3D videos, I will never use.

 Rather, PowerDirector will handle just about any video format I throw at it, has a clean, function-oriented interface that lets me edit video on a timeline with a minimum of hassle, will let me manage my audio tracks with a fair degree of simplicity, has a more than adequate tilter built-in and a zillion effects which most videographers will studiously steer of.

 You can do Ken Burns style videos, produce slideshows if you want and much, much more. Happily in the boxed version, they include a usable 250 page manual. You don't have to read it: just repeatedly browse it and you're learn a lot, not only about how to use PowerDirector, but about creating video as well. Good stuff. If you're just considering a purchase of PowerDirector v12, you can download the entire manual from the CyberLink  site. Do it  and youll see how powerful this software is as you read the detailed description of each function. Even were I to spell out the major features of PowerDirector here, I would not be doing the reader and prospective Cyberlink customer justice. Download the manual, set aside an hour or so and patiently read the manual (lots of pictures).

 Like I said, this has become my go-to software for day-to-day editing. Give it a try.

"This USB hub works just fine, and I love the design.

"This is the second time I have tried out the WillMaker software program. The first time was in 2012. This version doesn't have many noticeable changes from the first version, and that's fine. The product is still a good value and covers all of the basics. You will not be able to specify a lot of tiny, individual possessions in this program, but you can certainly write out all the minor stuff in your own handwriting and store that in a safe place. You could also take care of that by going to see a lawyer, but if you want to keep things cost effective it would be better to skip that. Like I said, this program will cover all of the basics and essentials (sort of like the basic tax return forms leave out peripheral stuff that not everyone needs) and will be fine for the majority of citizens living in the United States. I am very happy with its ease of use and low cost.",0
"I am dictating this review using MacSpeech Dictate. If I have to make a correction with my keyboard I will indicate the correction using brackets.

My wife knew I wanted this program so she bought [it] for me for Christmas. I had read many of the reviews and had decided I would wait until some of the bugs have [had] been worked out. So it was with some reticence that I loaded the program onto my computer Christmas day. From some of the reviews I thought it would blow my computer up. However, with some encouragement from my daughter I decided to install it. It was surprisingly easy. I did have two [to] download the patch from the MacSpeech website. But I was prompted to do so and everything went smoothly (I have a wireless Internet connection which made it easy).

It took me about 20 minutes to do the training. It went well. However, the first few times I tried to dictate it didn't go well. At first I feared it was a complete waste of money. After working with it for a while thing[s] started [to] work better until finally it seemed to work perfectly. I did do a few of the training exercises over again, just to be on the safe side. As you can see it's doing a pretty good job. Occasionally I use the recognition menu which allows you to verbally select from a list of options. This is especially good if there is a lot of background noise. I'm actually using it occasionally right now because I find it easier to dictate while I look at the screen. The manual tells you not to do that but for some reason for me it works better. I look at the screen while I type so it seems natural for me to look at the screen while I dictate.

So what initially seemed like a potential disaster turned out to be a lot of fun. I never let on to my wife that her gift initially terrorized me.

I don't really understand those who bash the program. Maybe they type a lot better than I do. In the final analysis I give MacSpeech Dictate high marks. Naturally it makes mistakes, and the mistakes can be hard to find because the program never misspell[s] anything. But all things considered it truly is amazing.

[I]incidentally, there is a great manual in the help menu. It has everything I needed to know about the program, plus some that [I] haven't gotten to yet but hope[d] to learn about soon (like using it to do commands in programs like Photoshop).

I dictated this review with only eight typos. That's a lot better than if I had typed everything.",0

"I've used quickbooks before, and some open source accounting software, and found this easier to install, but it is a very comprehensive package.  It comes with several sample companies that you can study or use to base your own company's files on.  There are also video tutorials to get you started.  I found them helpful.  More training is provided at a cost, but for basic accounting I can't see a need for it.
It seems a bit more powerful than perhaps what we need, but this certainly will scale up for sizable companies with much more complicated finances.
I like that it doesn't take a super powerful computer to run.  Mine is running on a desktop that's a 2 or 3 years old and wasn't top of the line by any means when new.  I installed Sage 50 when the desktop was running Windows 8, and it upgraded and runs fine on Windows 10.
Overall it seems a bit more complicated and a bit more powerful than quickbooks, though I don't find it hard to use, a lot will depend on one's level of comfort and experience with software in general.  It runs quite smoothly and doesn't slow my system down, and I like that a lot.

The software doesn't become useless after a year like some programs do, but support and updates do stop.
You can use this software to send price estimates, create sales orders, send bills/sales invoices, and enter receipts of money, as well as keep track of inventory and costs.
The software can be expanded, at additional cost, to cover doing payroll or taking credit and debit card payments.

Downside- It seems like overkill for a very small business.  However, if a small business were to grow rapidly, it should scale up very well along with the business.",0

"After installing this program (and activating it online) it adds a tab to the Office 2010 ribbon bar for PDF creation.  It couldn't be easier to create PDFs from Office documents.  While this one lacks the ability to batch convert, like PDF Converter does, it is easier to use generally.  After all, if you want to create PDFs, you are likely to be editing in Office when you need to create the PDF.

One caveat when running this program for the first time, however.  It will ask you if you want to make it your default PDF reader, DON'T!  It will come up with Vista Like security messages whenever you try to read PDFs with links in them.  Really a pain.  Stick to the free Adobe Reader as your PDF reading software.

Some people have complained about the DRM registration requirement, and while I agree with their points (this paranoid DRM scheme needs to end), I can't drop any stars as a result.  Maybe if I have to re-install some day and it won't let me, I'll come back here and knock off a couple of stars.",0
"This software does not change much from year to year. The reason we keep buying it is that the ""online"" features expire after three years. Personally I am quite comfortable with this arrangement. This year's model has a few bug fixes and a maybe two new features. You can see for yourself at Intuit's web site, there is not much. I found the upgrade installation to be perfect: no issues, no lost data, and reasonably quick.

There is already an update available from Intuit. The normal way to get updates is through the program itself, but this failed for me, repeatedly. I went to the Intuit web pile and downloaded the ""mondo patch."" Installing that was easy.

This is simply the best software of its kind available. Since Microsoft Money crapped out, there is no other software product that even comes close, in terms of features or usability. In my use, it is stable and dependable.

You should be aware that Intuit has put this product up for sale. No one seems to know what entity will take over the Quicken product line. Therefore, it is not possible to know how well the program will be maintained in the years to come.

Of particular interest is Quicken's ""one step update"" feature. Using this feature, you can download your banking and brokerage transactions directly into Quicken. I find this feature to be essential. It is by far the best method for detecting attacks on your accounts that are exposed to the internet. This feature isn't about software or technology. It is all about the business relationships that Intuit has built up over the years; with financial institutions all over North America and beyond. I am concerned about the future of these relationships.

I believe that anyone with either a family or a decent income should use Quicken. Spending and saving your money involves decisions every day. It is better to drive those decisions with data than to rely solely on your instincts. In spite of the uncertainty about Quicken's future, I would recommend it without reservation. I bought my 2016 copy soon after it went on sale here.

The modern alternative to Quicken is a fully web-based, free service such as Mint. You get what you pay for. You give away your privacy too.

Me, I will stick with Quicken as long as it is available. I back up my home computer frequently. My financial data is private and secure, living on my home disk drive and my encrypted backup drives.",0
"Install is easy - it offers to download latest version.  It checks your system for compatibility, then it downloads the app.  Not the other way around.  It is actually just an antivirus program, which is why I chose it.  I didn't want the entire internet security package, etc.  Since I do a lot of things via an internal network, usually the internet security/antivirus packages create other issues while trying to share files, printers, etc. on a local area network.

Pros
-The installation was straight forward and simple.
-Has a gaming mode - meaning it will turn off certain notification features while you are in the middle of games or certain apps that  use full screen mode.
-It offers a computer resources control.
-It offers a battery saving option.
-In the protection center it has off options for certain categories, but out of the box the full protection is on and for most, those  defaults will be fine.
Has a system watcher - it has the ability to roll back malware actions and can potentially detect and close screen lockers.  That could be very useful with the FBI virus and other locking viruses.
Offers the ability to create a rescue disk for detecting and eliminating computer infections.

All in all - I like the look and the ease of use so far seems to be great.  I would highly recommend this product.",0
"I am amazed at the negative reviews.

This software installs like a dream, and even if you don't need Norton Utilities, this is the essential software if you have a connection to the internet.

The Anti-virus software gets everything that McAfee fails to get, and is easily update-able. In fact everything about the NIS 2006 is easy to work.

Unless you have some serious  comprehension  issues, then this is a great choice. And I have it operating on a DELL 8200, a Multiboot DELL  8100, and an XPS ( I do have a 3 user License  version).

This is easy to install, as well as uninstall  where necessary, and is a good, and wise choice for safe computer use.",0

"For the first time in many years I have been pleased with a Microsoft Windows family OS.  When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.
Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.
This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.
The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)
I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.
As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.
I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:
* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever
* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start
* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP
* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically
* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP
* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.
* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.
And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.
In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.
I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.

"I have relied upon Paint Shop Pro for all of my graphics editing needs for many years. The software has eveloved for the better, and it can still meet the demands of both hobbyists, and professionals alike.

I have become accustomed to the three-tab interface that has been a part of the software for a few versions now. It helps to have one place for hand-crafted graphics editing tasks separated from the photo touch up features, which I rarely use, but have found to be exceptionally effective when needed.

I'm not much on using third-party software to organize my collection of photos, but Paint Shop Pro adds categories not available at the operating system level, and iprovides efficient search options for large collections.

My favorite part of X8 is how much faster the tools perform compared to the last version I had used. The preview for the text and shape cutter is such an improvement. I like the clean, uncluttered look of the workspace.

There's not much reason to skimp out on going for the Ultimate package. Perfect Effects does some really cool stuff, and though I rarely need to fix photographs, I am glad to have the tools ready when I need them.

X8 is an excellent upgrade, and I am more happy with it than ever. I get some CorelDRAW-like features in a more consumer-budget package. It's a winner.",0

This best thing about it is how it integrates each part of your business and allows you to quickly create forms while simultaneously keeping track of finances and inventory.

"I have been running 2013 Plus for almost a year on 2 Windows 8 Pro 64bit computers. It has worked flawlessly. With several scheduled backups on each at different times and backup locations.
 I recieved an offer directly from Acronis to upgrade to 2014. I emailed them as to what improvments were made and they said Interface and cloud/Network backup. I thought I would give it a try.
 Glad I did. It is much faster than 2013. The GUI is a little cleaner.
 I have now got 3 Win 8 computers running Acronis Premium. 2014. They all have multiple backups to different locations. No problems at all.
 I recommend intergrating Acronis into the Windows boot. It gives an ""F11"" Boot option at bootup, so you can go into Acronis instead of booting. Restores and backups both work from a ""Linux"" enviroment. It works great. You can also make bootable media from Acronis to do the same thing on DVD or CD.
 Warning....This is a powerful product. Please read the Manual.
 The ""Clone feature"" is in my opinion, the best on the market. I have done several and they worked everytime.
 Also recommended is to set frequent ""Validation"" of all backups. Just  to make sure they will work.
 If you need a powerful Clone/Backup program this is a Highly recommended buy.",0
"Internet Security is something that everybody should have, but it should not be something that should be visible until it is needed is my feeling. I thing Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 does a great job of doing just that.
Most of the time I do not even know it is there, (except for the pulsating ""K"" in my toolbar). Kaspersky has got to be one of the quickest most reliable Anti Virus and Internet Security out there. Of course, if you would like to know more about what it is doing, you can change the settings to keep you informed. That is another great feature, for the novice, the out of the box settings work fine, but for the more PC literate you can tweak your settings until they are just right for your level of expertise. It is very customizable.

I upgraded from Kaspersky Internet Security 2010, and the 2011 version has a slicker interface, with a line that zips across like on the bottom of the screen on the original Star Trek Enterprise to let you know it is working. The addition of ""Safe Run"" to the side is something new, and really cool! It is almost like a virtual machine, without the virtual machine. There are 2 ways to run Safe Run - for applications or for websites. When you select either one, a green neon like glow appears around either your desktop or web browser to indicate it is active. What it does is isolate them from the rest of your system. So let's say you got a link and you don't trust the source, simply click on the Safe Run for Websites, your browser will open with the green glow, and you are protected. It basically works the same way for applications creating a Safe Desktop environment which allows you to open files of a questionable nature. There is also a virtual keyboard as part of the safe run component that allows you to ""type"" with your mouse on a pop up keyboard for the most security on banking sites and anything else that requires more privacy. Use this especially if you suspect there is a keylogger on your system.

It is really difficult to judge how effective any Anti-Virus software is unless you throw a known virus at it and see how it behaves. Well, (unless you are in a lab testing software) who in their right mind would infect their own machine? So, without scientific testing any opinions on anti-virus software is truly objective. I must say though that Kaspersky's anti-virus component continually runs in the background in real time protecting you against everything out there. On the main user interface page, the Protection Center ticks off the number of overall scanned files, which in my case is 15,794,775 and increasing as I type. This protection has caught a few Trojans from some websites, which it Quarantined immediately, letting me know with a big red notification telling me so. Now that's what I'm talking about, quiet until needed.

There are so many different components to Kaspersky Internet Security besides anti-virus, to review them would take so many pages so I will only comment on a few in this review. Kaspersky breaks its Protection Center down into 3 categories: Files and Private Data Protection (which includes File Anti-Virus, Application Control and Proactive Defense), System And Applications Protection (which includes Mail Anti-Virus, Web Anti-Virus, IM Anti-Virus, Application Control, System Watcher, Proactive Defense, Network Attack Blocker and Anti-Spam), Online Security (which adds Firewall, anti-Phishing and Anti-Banner to 4 previously mentioned components).

The firewall is definitely one of the best, it is triggered with a pop up message when I remote in to other machines (which I would hope it would), yet allows it because it is on the same local network. I would expect that it would be denied from an outside network, unless there were specific rules in place. The firewall is highly configurable, yet in most cases the default rules should be fine for the average user. The application control is also good at spotting activity that may not necessarily be normal for a particular application and will warn you if it is ok to proceed. I also like the region notification that you can set on your browser. It will let you know if your browser is sending traffic to places it should not be going. I found it sending traffic to Iran and just the other day Libya, which I immediately denied access to these nations. This is not turned on by default, so if you like this feature you will need to enable it.

I have used Bit Defender, Norton, McAffee, AVG, Webroot, Avast, among many other Internet Security programs and I have found this one to be the best one for me. I have it on all of my Windows machines. The only thing that I dislike is the occasional hit in performance when the program performs an update, but it is nowhere near as bad as Norton. You will see a little globe in the ""K"" in your toolbar when the update occurs, so at least it lets you know what is going on if you notice a little slow down. Maybe faster servers might help, but at least it does the updates on its own every hour without any involvement from you.",0
"I am a 15-year Photoshop user, I love it and consider it second to none, and I will continue to use it as my primary photo editing software.

Having said that, I also have to admit that this is an incredibly rich program for the price. I was in a rush trying to get one of a limited number available during a cyber Monday promotion and I clicked to purchase before they were all gone. I thought I was getting Painter (which I've wanted to try for a while). I almost was going to return it when I started carefully reading what the program contains and what it can do. Curiosity got the best of me, and I'm glad.

While I don't find the interface especially intuitive--even if I wasn't used to a different workspace--I think that it can't be that difficult to learn. I'm impressed that it handles RAW files, that it had an HDR module, that it not only performs the basic image editing and color correction functions but it also does photo blending, skin smoothing, and noise removal, that it has text functions, works with layers and 16-bit images--really does a lot for the money!

Is it capable of doing everything at a top professional level? I don't think so. But it has enough power so that the average person's normal photograph with typical problems will very well processed with minimal effort.

Since I'm not familiar with Photoshop Elements, I'm not sure how these two programs would compare in either functionality, interface, or quality of output. I don't think that it can be said to compete with full Photoshop--but then it costs less than 1/10th what Photoshop costs! I'm also a bit of a control freak and I didn't find the level of control and fine tuning I'm used to. But I'm impressed with the number of functions and features that Corel has packed into this program.

Additionally, I've always wanted to get Nik Color Effects Pro plugin, and it comes included with this program. That, alone, is worth the purchase price. I can bring in any file saved in Photoshop and try any of the Nik effects or other effects that might be similar but different from what I have in my ""serious"" program. Then it has some fun frame process that creates a clip-art like embellishment for photos, cards, scrapbooking, or invitations (for some reason, they are called Picture Tubes). Not high art, but fun things you don't find in Photoshop. For the hobbyist, this is the better program.

All in all, it's a LOT of program for comparatively little money.",0
"NAV 2008 is so much faster than previous versions. I can browse and shop online knowing my laptop is protected. I recommend this product to everyone. I use it on my game computer and it run smoth. I'll recomend this solution for everone, there is no better solution out there in the shop's",0
"The CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 is not a program for a casual user. It is a powerful suite of software used for a variety of graphic art, webpage design, flash animation, and more. It is not my intent to go over every feature the software package, since there are many outstanding reviews already posted. However, I would like to hit the highlights.

- When compared to Adobe Photoshop - as a pure graphics program it is tough to beat Adobe Photoshop. Most of us grew up using Photoshop and Adobe, so in many ways it is intuitive. The CorelDraw Premium Suite has many additional features which helps it to become a one-stop solution. In terms of price both programs are roughly at the same price point.

- What features do you need? As I stated above CorelDRAW is fully loaded suite of software - the question is - do you need it all? Will you need the video editing software or are you more comfortable with a rival program? Do you need to have the ability to create Flash media? If so.... by all means the CorelDRAW Premium Suite is probably perfect for you!

- The Video Editor - Perfect for YouTube and most video editing applications. While it may not rival Final Cut Pro it will serve the needs of a vast majority of your video needs.... now if you are planning to edit a full length feature film my opinion may be a bit dfferent.

- Installation - You can pick and choose the programs that you want to install.

Final Verdict - CorelDRAW Premium Suite is a very robust software package. The reason why I am giving it 5 stars is that it may not have the absolute best software for your application it does provide a VERY good option for everything and in terms of value that earns a 5 star recommendation from me.

5 Stars",0
I buy this every year.  It's simple to use and a lot cheaper than an accountant.  Use it every year and it keeps track of former returns so you can't accidently skip an entry.,0
"Corel does some really good work on their graphics software. It's not quite as robust on features as Adobe's equivalents, but the price difference is pretty huge.

I wouldn't actually recommend this for pretty casual use, because you'll be paying for a lot of features that go beyond what you really need. You could probably get something for 1/4 the price or something that would do fine and you'd have something that's a little easier to use. If you want to be able to do pretty sophisticated work without investing in a top end professionally priced product, though, this can do a very good job.",0
"Pinnacle Studio 19 Plus is  good mid-level video editing software. Its price point and functionality are targeted towards the beginner-intermediate editor, and it works reliably, has powerful editing capabilities, and import/export functionality. I run it on a Windows 10 computer (about 1.5 years old) and haven't had an issues with it. This is a solid software choice if you're looking for editing software for personal or family videos, or for basic work/technical film editing.

The learning curve is reasonable and in 1-2 hours, you can do basic editing and video composition. The more sophisticated inputs and channels will take a little longer to learn - but still approachable. The interface of the program isn't too cluttered, and common tools have shortcuts.

YouTube has been invaluable for finding tutorials on how to do different things, and I've relied on it a lot.",0
"As a disclaimer, I've been using TurboTax for years so it's impossible to be completely objective but I'll do my best to just report on my experience. First, it's difficult to give a full review at this time of year since W2s and other tax documents haven't been released. However, there is some prep work that can be done immediately.
Installation: Easy as can be. Comes on a CD and installed quickly and without issue. I installed to the default location as I believe this makes it easier for TT to find prior year tax files.
Update: After installation the program checked for updates and found them, giving me the option to update the software. I did and this also ran without a hitch. This is important as tax forms, rules, and regulations change regularly.
Tax Prep: I started the program and began my 2014 tax return. TT found my 2013 file and loaded all the prior year data in prep for this year's taxes. I went as far as I could, which wasn't too far, and saved the file until I get all my tax documents.

TT 2014 is just as easy to use as prior versions. The interface is the same and the control of how you want to proceed through the program, self-directed or led by TT, is your choice. Other products may be as good or nearly as good, but I can't imagine there's an easier or better way to prepare your taxes. Highly recommended.",0
"I'm a big Mac user, but my job uses PCs. That's always been an issue for me working on programs that aren't Mac. I wind up working twice as hard to make files compatible between both platforms, and half the time I lose formatting.

I never tried a virtual program before, and I have to say, with so many others, that VMware Fusion is simplicity itself: drag and drop installation, opens PC programs seamlessly, and has my job easier since I can work from home, and move files over with no issues.

The only thing I'd say is to max out your RAM (but you're doing that anyway, aren't you?)

Highly recommend.",0
"I always run hot and cold on these photo and video editing programs. Some programs offer too much flexibility (Photoshop), while others completely fall short (I'll let you fill that one in). Some provide too many additional add-on features, some provide none. With PD5 Ultra, Cyberlink has hit the sweet spot for me, as I am not a professional photographer, but want to be able to manage and edit my work.

Installation was easy and smooth on my WIndows 7 64-bit computer (yes, it's got native 64-bit support). Start-up is very quick, and the interface is excellent - a neutral grey that makes it easy to work with your photos. Importing is easy and relatively quick, letting you get to work almost right away.

There are five main sections: library, edit, slidewshow, print, and adjustment.

The Library section is great. It's basic, but really works nicely and smoothly, gathering all my photos into one easy-to-navigate and searchable place. It's often the libraries that I dislike the most in these programs, but I'm very happy with the one in PD 5.

Adjustment lets you tweak thinks like white balance, color, tone, tinge, etc - you'll be familiar with these as they're settings found in most cameras. Don't want to go manual? There are a huge number of presets available as well, for those that like to grab and go Instagram style, and they're all quite good. An excellent and well balanced set of tools overall.

Edit provides the full suite of tools one would expect; object removal, merge, frames, effects, etc. For the most part, the effects are excellent and varied. The extract tool works fairly well (using a lasso or smart-tool) and the ability to tweak the results is a welcome feature. Object removal works well too, though depending on the subject matter it can struggle from time to time.

Slideshow and print are simple and what you would expect: ways to build slideshows or set up printing.

Honestly, the program is too deep to list everything it can do in one place. Cyberlink provides a bunch of tutorials that are set up to help beginners and experts alike get the most from the program - and there's a lot to get.

It runs rock solid, looks great, has a suite of excellent tools and allows beginners to get going while more advanced users can dig deeper. A fantastic program, a great choice and now my go-to photo editing software.",0
"To start off, The shipping was a day early but I liked it. Now Microsoft must have faced some negative reviews about Windows 8 and 8.1. However, 8.1 is not that bad as what most people think. In fact I like the update Microsoft released. Now I am coming off a class I took in college 2 years about and we were taught some windows 8 Basics. So navigating through 8.1 was a no brainer for me. Now notice this is not the Professional version. I assume the edition of it is the windows 7 equivalent to Home premium. And this is the OEM as well so it is intended for new system builds, which is why I purchased this product. I t is for my dad's new computer build by me. There is Windows 8 and 8.1 books out there for people who are confused about this operating system or take an online seminar. All and all, This is replacing all Windows 7 Platforms (well most because you can still buy Windows 7 PC's) and the price is perfectly fine for me. I am satisfied with this purchase and will train my Windows XP dad about this Operating system.",0

"I was being a little brave to give Norton AV another try. I've been a computer pro for a LONG time (sadly too long as evidenced by the numbers describing my birthdays these days LOL), and in the past I had a lot of trouble with Norton AV. At one time I used to call it the ""Norton Anti-Virus Virus"", because it routinely caused more issues than the viruses it promised to protect against.

However, this release has so far not caused me any grief like that. It seems to be safely tucked out of the way of interfering with the things I need to conventionally do with my computer, while providing the Virus protection we all need these days. I can't speak to the mobile device protection. I haven't tried that and am not likely to. I don't do anything at all with my mobile devices that have any chance to cause problems, so it just isn't worth it (to me) to go that extra mile to try it out in that manner.",0

Federal efile is free with code supplied on CD sleeve. I don't see any difference with turbo tax, except that with H&R block, audit support is free. I can't remember if I had to pay to efile state taxes with Turbotax last year. Anyhow, H&R block software is a very good alternative to Turbotax - the reason I bought it is because is cheaper than Turbotax and had used H&R block tax software before and had no problems then either. I don't remember why I bought Turbotax last year - I think it had better reviews and I had some really complicated estate stuff last year. This year H&R block got better reviews in some places that Turbotax.",0

"This version of Office is a pleasant step up from the 2003 I've been using. Excel was  little quirky in that it crashed a lot until I made a couple tweaks I read about in the Office Community pages. However, I'm upgrading to 2013 this week simply because the mainstream support of 2007 is expiring this fall (Oct 2017).  It was typically easy to install and it allowed me to keep my Office 2003 version without any problems. Converting my old jspreadsheets to the 2007 format was easy but I strongly recommend saving any Excel sheets in the 2007 format xlsm (macro enabled) because until I did that all my docs would freeze up and Excel just crashed every time I opened a doc. I gave Word a quick test drive and it seems fine. I really really like the easy of inserting tables.  I've yet to try Word out on any of my larger docs (700 page novel, for example) but I don't foresee any troubles. Overall, I like it but I still am upgrading.",0

"I, like many people, used WordPerfect back in the day (late eighties). But over the years I moved on to using Microsoft Word as it became the de facto standard in most work places. I pretty much quit using MS Office at home when I left teaching and switched over to using a free license of Open Office. But I've been wanting to get back to using something a bit more polished. So when I was offered to try out the latest standard WordPerfect office suite from Corel I was happy to do so.

Installation was a snap. Individual icons get created on your desktop, as well as on the program menu. I'm running Windows 7 Professional.

WordPerfect is a lot different than it was back in the DOS days, but still very similar to any of the other Windows based word processors I've used over the years. I really haven't had to hunt too long to find where everything is located. Quattro-Pro is great, I use to use it a long time ago and am very happy to start using it again. Presentations - back when I was teaching, I use to create a ton of slideshows. Nowdays I really don't have a need to.

To test this new suite out, I opened a lot of my archived curriculum that I've developed over the years. Pretty much everything opened and worked fine. One minor quibble, some of the Powerpoint files had a issue with the display order of things - for example, text blocks that were obscured by graphics. But nothing that wasn't easily fixed. Quattro-Pro was a standout, everything I tried worked perfect and there were more options than I think I've ever seen for presenting data.

One thing that I really wanted to test out, but haven't had the opportunity is the ebook creation function of WordPerfect. I really want to set down and test this out more before commenting on it. I will update my review when that is done.

All-in-all, I really like this new Corel WordPerfect Office Suite and would recommend it.",0

In 2011 I switched to  Kaspersky Internet Security on each PC and the problems stopped.  This year I installed Kaspersky Pure on each system and have experienced zero problems.  There have been many warnings and much whining about restricted access to several popular web sites or but there have been no issues  - NONE!

I realize my review does not address technical issues  addressing CPU %, system resources, etc (ad nauseum).  In a real world, Kaspersky delivers results.  What a concept!",0
Best program to use. I would tell everyone to get all Microsoft  then the program give to us by our internet.,0
"Paint Shop Pro X7 Ultimate is a great program that offers a lot of features. Comparable to Photoshop Full, it offers a wide range of creating, editing, adjusting, and manipulation tools.  Even though I prefer Photoshop a slight bit more, especially since I've been using that for the past seven years, this program offers a similar experience to Photoshop. If you have experience working with past version of either, you know what you are getting. If you are new to photo creating/editing/manipulating, both program require you to learn how to use the features. PSPro has video and written tutorials available on its website (link through PSPro), that explain the features. It takes practice to get good at these programs.

The Magic Fill tool works great in the tutorial, but worked okay for most of my photos. I had to apply it multiple times to get the photo I wanted. It is a feature that does complex work, so don't expect it to work wonders or work perfectly every time. Sometimes manually doing the work instead of using the Magic Fill tool will provide better results. But definitely try the Magic Fill tool first.

I worked with the new RAW editor and it's good. It's not as good as the Photoshop RAW Editor due to less precision in its adjustments, but it did help edit RAW images nicely. It works quickly and smoothly, although one or two features did require a few seconds to think before applying.

The Face Tagging program does a great job most of the time, and an average job some of the time of finding faces in photos. It will search through the photos you specify in folders and bring up the faces. Then you create a new name or specify the name to associate with that face. You have to do this with every photo.  But the process quick. Then you can just click on a name in the work area and it will bring up every photo associated with that name. A great way to find photos.  The feature works very smoothly (using my PC specs) and quickly. I am using a Intel Core i5 3.1Ghz PC with 12 GB of RAM. I am running 64-bit Win 8.1 Pro.

You get two discs: Paint Shop Pro X7 Ultimate on the first disc, and FaceFilter Studio 3 on the second disc. PSPX7U requires 337 MB of space for the install.  Install takes about 7 minutes. I'm using a Core i7 with 12 GB of RAM. The program runs very smoothly while editing photos. After registering, you get access to free video tutorials, free written tutorials, tips, and their
knowledgebase.

I've been using Photoshop Elements for the last 7 years. For one year, I used the full version of Photoshop. I enjoy photo editing and manipulation, but I haven't had the need to use the full version of Photoshop every year. Paint Shop Pro is a great alternative to Photoshop. It is very similar in functionality. PSPro offers a wide range of brushes and tools, but at a lower cost than Photoshop Full. Working with layers, photo editing, removing objects, using filters. All those are the same as Photoshop. PSPro runs mostly smooth on my Intel Core i5 3.1Ghz PC with 12 GB of RAM. I am running 64-bit Win 8.1 Pro.

TUTORIALS: There are video tutorials and written tutorials available on the Corel website, and the link to them is also available in the PSPro program. They are useful tutorials. Some of the features are not intuitive. There are some details provided for each feature at the bottom when you click on it, but trying to find certain things and how to use them properly takes some getting used to. I definitely had to research how to do a few things I do so easily in Photoshop. Good thing for the tutorials though.

The 64-bit and 32-bit versions are included.  After importing photos, you can add star ratings and tags to photos. You can't do this during the import. You can save photos in about 35 different file types, including PSD Photoshop format. You can customize the workarea by closing out windows and panels you don't need. When working on photos, you will see the changes occur directly on the image you are editing/adjusting. Some of the options do need a few seconds to apply your changes. Most simple changes of features occur instantly. You may be expecting instant changes, but some of the advanced features do require time to calculate and implement.

Paint Shop Pro X7 Ultimate runs smoothly, but I find that Photoshop Elements runs a bit smoother for me by about 10%, and Photoshop Full ran even faster by another 10%.  It's not a huge speed difference, but it is noticeable a few times. If you are serious about learning how to create, edit, or manipulate photos, this program will help you do some amazing things. But you will need to spend the time learning the features. Learning this program is just as time consuming as learning Photoshop would be. But it will let you do some amazing things that will let you impress others with your photo skills.",0

"I didn't realize how heavy Kaspersky was running until I got Norton.  I was using McAfee before that.  Fan of McAfee that I am, I might daresay that Norton runs more smoothly than McAfee.  It's so light on resources, I don't even know it's there.

I installed Norton onto my Android phone.  The biggest problem is accessing the anti-theft feature via the web.  The Norton site is slow.  I was only able to access it today.  Other days, it would just stall.

We get a code when we first install Norton onto our phone.  Remember that code.  It allows us to send commands to our phone via text.  We can lock our phone, makes it scream, locate or wipe it.  I locked my phone remotely just to try out that feature and it was instantaneous.  That's very reassuring to me.  If you forget the passcode, it is available on the website, through the anti-theft page that is so difficult to load.

This is an annual subscription that has a limit of ten devices.  Cloud storage for backups is included, but I didn't use that.  Do I like Norton?  Very much so.  It has earned itself a new fan in me.",0

"I LOVE WordPerfect, have been using it since before Windows so I have had 5.1, 6, 9 and 12.  Just recently, I purchased the standard edition of WordPerfect Office X4, one for my XP workhorse and one for my husband's Windows 7 model.

Since this item has been reviewed for nearly two years, I won't duplicate the other comments, especially those that go into depth with what the suite can do.  Let me say, however, that I have used and enjoy the fact that Quattro Pro is interchangeable with Excel.  As a writer, I always preferred WP's capability to Word's and still find it the superior word processor.  Now with a neat clipboard like Lightning and the wondrous capability to write or modify PDF files without memory hungry Adobe Acrobat, I'm in heaven.

I performed a clean install without a problem on both machines.  Decided not to use the email program because I love my old Eudora and prefer not to change.

WP Office X4 is Vista compliant; I also find it works beautifully with the Windows 7 64 bit machine.

*Easily identifies unsafe websites.

You can see the results just by going to Google.  It uses a simple green, yellow and red system to identify the website.  As you hover over a link, it will give you a more extensive review of the website.  I'm an avid surfer and even I was amazed how some of the website I used to think are safe are not necessarily safe.

"I have reviewed a number of products over the years for virus protection and general security. My major concerns tend to be in order: does it work (is it actually catching anything?), system resource usage (when active and in background), memory footprint (how much of my system memory does it use) - both of the last bear directly on the impact on other program performance - and lastly ease of customization.

On all counts this product has been a success in my opinion, it has reported numerous cookie and Trojans discovered over the past 6 months (highlighting risky websites before I traveled to them). It does tend to be a little more resource intensive while scanning than some other products I have used (both during active and background scans), noticeably slowing down other software. The memory footprint is small and certainly competitive with the best products I have used in the past. Customization of scan schedules, and trusted sites/senders is fairly easy, and certainly competitive.

Kapersky and Viper were past favorites for their small footprint, low impact of system performance and ease of use. I have panned McAfee and Norton for their piggish use of system resources and difficulty in customization. My overall feel for this product is that while it may not be what I would consider a best buy (mostly due to system slow down while scanning even in background mode), it is much closer to my preferred products than those I do not like and can comfortably recommend it.

Can you say you love a tax program? Well the H & R Block Tax software is worthy of that claim. It was easy to install and start using right away. I have used Turbo Tax for 25 years and was very unhappy when they changed the software. The H & R Block Tax software is all I need as a homeowner with some investments. I am a new loyal customer.,0
"I have used the iWork Suite since it was first released. iWork 08' adds Numbers which is comparable to Microsoft's Excel. The other two apps called Pages and Keynote are equivalents to Word and Powerpoint respectively. I use these even though I have Microsoft Office 2008. These are just easier and faster for me to use. I still open office docs sent to me in Office, but otherwise I create docs on Pages. If your an Apple fan you can't go wrong here. If your a business user you will probably want this and Office 2008. iWork 08 is not a complete Office replacement yet, especially if you need to send Office compatible docs to Windows users.",0

At first it was asking for my credit card but I went back to the beginning and it allowed me to skip that step. Immediately it found two ""threats"" that had ""low"" risks. Basically it removed tracking/advertising software which is find. I'm going to try it on my HP Stream (web based computing) and will update if it gives any problems.",0
"After tring different partitioning software i purchased this program and absolutly LOVE IT! The interface is great and it gives you a good amount of detail of your hard drive(S) that windows does not. But the greatest thing about this program is the wizards. There is a wizard for everything that you would want to do in creating, resizing, moving, formating. The wizards take you through step by step in easy to understand terms for anyone type of computer novice or expert. It makes suggestings and seys up the partition even if you want to install a second operating system (like linux or a different version of windows) and tells you why that is the best option to use. Once you deciede what you want to do it will reboot the systme and automacially start doing its job which it does faster than any other program i have used and it never damages any data you already have on your hard drive.",0

"I've used Norton 360 since 2009, except for a 6 month time period about a year ago when I tried Avast-Free which left me with 2 Trojan files that Norton 360 picked up on the minute I re-installed it. Since this is a 3 PC copy, I also installed it on my old desktop PC I use for work projects, and on my netbook. This runs unobtrusively in the background, even when doing a short scan, and doesn't slow any of my PC's down.

Here is what I have mine installed on:

Home Desktop PC: Windows 8.1, 3.4 Ghz Processor, 4 GB memory, Chrome browser
Home Netbook: Windows 7 Starter, 1.66 Ghz Processor, 2 GB memory, Mozilla Firefox browser, latest version
Old Desktop PC: Windows XP Professional, 2.4 Ghz Processor, with only 512K memory

I also think it's smarter to purchase the CD in lieu of downloading from Amazon. I like to have a physical copy in my hand in lieu of a download. Similarly, buy the CD instead of updating direct from Norton's web site. It's always more expensive from Symantec's site than buying a new installation CD here.",0

"I have used every Windows version since Windows v1. This is the best version, yet.

It is much more stable than 98SE, 98 or 95. It is more stable than my 2000 as well. It actually is considered a 2000 upgrate -- from 5.0 to 5.1 -- but the feature changes are more dramatic and should warrant a 5.5 or 6.0. It is finally multi-user (not multi-account like 2000), so all users can stay logged on with applications running.

I had to call Microsoft to complete the upgrade and found the tech. support to be very helpful.  I still cannot use my sound card properly, but was told that may happen, so I was not surprised.  I really like the Vista over the XP, which is only a personal preference.  If I had known I would have to do the custom install ahead of time I would have just went ahead and bought the full version instead of the upgrade version, but over all I am pleased with the product and would recommend it.",0

"Over the past two weeks, I have been testing the VMware Fusion 2 product.  Wow, I have to admit that I am seriously impressed with this software package.  It truly makes using Windows a seamless experience that is truly enjoyable!  Here is what's so great about Fusion 2:

1) It makes installing Windows a fun and ""fearless"" experience.

In the past, I have always used Apple's Bootcamp (a competing product) to run Windows on my Macbook Pro (2.4 GHz with 4 GB of RAM).  Only problem is that Apple's Bootcamp program can be a ""little confusing"" to use -- and when I first went to install Windows on my new Mac, I apparently didn't read the technical installation manually as carefully as I should of, and accidentally wound up wiping out my machine to the point that it wouldn't start.  Oh oh...  Not good!  ;-)  I eventually got it back up and running, with Windows installed on it, but it really wasn't the most user-friendly way of installing Windows on my Mac!

However, with the introduction of VMware's Fusion 2, the process of installing Windows just became a real snap!  When I first started the program, it asked me if I would like to install Windows on my computer.  I said yes and it prompted me to insert my Windows installation disc into the drive.  The moment that I did this, it took control over the installation and after a bit, I have Windows freshly installed on my computer!  (Also, for those of you who want to use your Bootcamp partition, they give you the option of simply using it, or even migrating it directly to your Mac, as a virtual drive -- which helps to free up tons of space on your drive!)  It works seamlessly...

2) Run both Windows and Mac applications together at once!

This is one seriously cool feature of VMware Fusion 2.  Since Windows is running virtually on your machine, it means that you can unify both your Microsoft Office applications and your Mac programs together as one powerful software suite.  Fusion 2 comes with a feature called ""Unify"" that allows me to start up my Mac contacts and Microsoft Excel at the same time.  I can exchange information between these programs simply by using ""copy and paste""!  Also, unlike Apple's Bootcamp software, I don't have to reboot my system every time that I want to use a program from the other OS.  This makes both me and my Mac more productive!

3) Run your favorite PC games on the Mac!

If you're like me, you probably enjoy a little break here and then -- and that means playing a computer game, once in a while.  ;-)  Best of all, with Fusion 2, you can enjoy a wide selection of PC games on your Mac, as if they were designed for it.

4) Excellent Hardware Support

Out of all of the virtualization that I have played with over the years, Fusion 2 (by far) is years ahead of the competition.  They have written plug-ins for your operating systems that enable full hardware support, such as iSight cameras, USB drives and the ability to print over the network.  These are very welcomed features in my mind that place this software package above the competition.  This helps to make running Windows (and Linux) a vastly superior option.

THE DISADVANTAGES:
Honestly, it's kind of hard to find very many with this program, as it seems that the developers took the time needed to develop a well-tested application.  However, I did find a few, minor issues that you will want to be aware of:

- Product Deactivation for Bootcamp users

If you already have Windows installed and running on your computer, Fusion 2 gives you the ability to run it virtually.  When I ran Windows XP virtually for the first time, Windows immediately deactivated both the operating system and my copy of Microsoft Office.  Also, Adobe Creative Suite CS2 immediately deactivated too, which was not good.  To fix this, I had to reactivate my products, which means that you may have to spend some time on the phone waiting for customer service to give you permission to re-use your software again.

- There seems to be an issue with Time Machine.  I have a USB hard drive connected to my Macbook Pro and while it's connected, it actually prevents Windows XP from being able to successfully boot.  To fix this problem, simply disconnect the drive (during the booting process) and everything will work fine!

- Out of two weeks of heavy usage, I experienced only one minor crash.  VMware Fusion 2 handled it beautifully and no data was lost.

IN SUMMARY:
This is one AWESOME product that I highly recommend.  Don't waste your time with Apple's Bootcamp -- make the switch of being able to truly enjoy your mac the way you want.  Yes, nowadays, who says you can't have it all...  ;-)",0
"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on ""Download Software"" on the top banner, and select ""State Editions"".  Currently it says ""Available in January 2014"".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled ""Buy"" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy"" will turn into ""update"" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"TTax2013 is solid and fast as were the prior tax-year versions.  Thankfully you can usually pick it up at a discounted price ($50 -vs- $60) at Amazon earlier than from other sellers (Intuit is usually the LAST one to offer a price-break),  I have only bought TTax on CD over the years (not digital download) so that I have the disc just in case I might need to re-install at some future (like IF the TaxMan were to come a'knockin', God forbid).  Point being I can't comment on the Download approach.
My only gripe with Intuit (not this package, per se) is the $40 gouge price for an additional State.  At thathigh price, it's got to be a super-high margin item for Intuit's bottom line.

Off-topic slightly, I *do* wish that Intuit would:
 - Make TTax available for Linux operating systems  (likely won't happen though, given that TTax & Quicken both rely on Microsoft Windows' .Net framework;
 - Make a TurboTax- style program for preparing and filing Federal Estate, Gift, and Trust returns.  (Maybe they will. should considering the aging Baby Boomer demographics).",0

"Snow Leopard may look the same as Leopard on the surface, but the more you use it, the more you realize just how comprehensive and powerful an update it is!  From the initial installation, you will notice that your Mac is snappier - and if you look at the space on your hard drive, you'll see that installing Snow Leopard has freed up more than a few gigabytes of space.  As you go about your normal workflow, you'll start to stumble onto things that are just - well - better.  I'll give you one example.  I decided that I wanted to relocate my iTunes Library, but that I didn't want it to take an entire drive.  I have several 1TB externals, and one looked tempting.  But it was formatted with a single partition.  I did a brief search in the Mac help section and was delighted to find that I am no longer stuck with static partitioning on formatted drives. In the past, if I wanted to resize a partition, it was a complicated process, first backing up all data on the drive, then using disk utility to reformat and then partition the drive, and finally copying my data to the new partitions.  With Leopard, all that is consolidated into one step.  In disk utility, I can select the ""partition"" option, drag the size of my existing partition to release space on the drive (or type in a number to specify exactly how big I want the partition to be!)  Then create a new partition or partitions in the empty space - No loss of data, no reformatting, dead simple.  This is a powerful feature, which used to require third party software to accomplish.  And Snow Leopard is full of such ""Aha!"" moments.  A great update to an already great OS.",0

I have been using Windows since 3.0 and have used every flavor with mixed success.  I know how to tweak settings and manually steamline a Windows OS.  Vista is not cooperative.  It's top heavy with pretty blingy glitz that hogs system recourses and slows even the best behaved applications to a crawl.  Then there's the issue that not all software is compatible or works properly in the new OS.  Worse, even after turning off most every feature I could including indexing, Vista still engaged in computer-freezing disk writes that lasted for 10's of minutes at a time for no apparent reason; Microsoft help is at a loss to explain.

"Dragon NaturallySpeaking's ability to recognize and properly interpret spoken words within the context they are spoken makes it a useful tool when it comes to dictation (speech to text), controlling a Windows computer, interacting with applications such as Internet Browsers and search engines, the Microsoft Office suite of apps and, through proper customization, just about any Windows app.

After a couple of weeks of experiencing the Dragon, words that come to mind to describe my impressions would be: well-thought, mature, polished, complex, depth, cutting edge, features rich, trainable, expandable, artificially intelligent, versatile. Closer runner-ups would be: essential, time-saver, productivity enhancer, precise, breakthrough - and I may be able to validate these and move them into the first tier of descriptors eventually but a couple more months of daily use may be needed.

I am using the Dragon with my email (Outlook and Gmail), text messengers such as Microsoft's Communicator, producing quick drafts and with some internet Browser (Chrome) activities such as navigating inside the active tab (page up/down), switching tabs and quick Google and Wikipedia searches. Also some interaction with the Operating System such as opening/closing apps, saving docs and so on. But, of course, there's a lot more to the Dragon than what I am using it so I will provide what will hopefully be a brief overview based on my own experience.

OPERATION

Dragon works is by listening to your spoken words and trying to make sense of what it hears. If it decides that the words were a 'command', the Dragon decides whether the command concerns the Dragon itself or whether it has to do with the Operating System or the foreground application. Then the command is executed. Otherwise, the Dragon listens to the stream of spoken words and identifies words based on context, statistics of past word usage, custom vocabulary, user-provided training, user profile data, etc., etc. Once the words are identified, the output is produced based on yet another set of rules.

SETTING UP THE DRAGON

The initial setup was not exactly 'quick' but the no-nonsense thoroughness actually persuaded me that I was dealing with a serious, mature, well-thought piece of software.

One of Setup's first steps is to identify an 'audio source' and Dragon supports most audio inputs a PC supports: USB, Bluetooth, a microphone or a digital recorder plugged into the Line-in jack, sound files, a Pocket PC device used as a digital recorder.

After the audio source is identified, the user will specify his/her age, location (US, NZ, Australia, UK, India, SE Asia...), accent (standard American, Middle America, Southern, Indian, Australian, UK...).

Then, training begins. Volume and the audio equipment quality is tested, then the user is asked to read a specific test. To further enhance its word-guessing capabilities the Dragon then ask for permission to take a look at the user's text documents (My Docs) and emails.

This completes the initial setup.

TRAINING THE DRAGON

As suspected, the setup is just the beginning. To improve word recognition accuracy, the user is expected to constantly fine-tune the application or rather the profile that the Dragon creates for the user.

There are user-initiated tasks such as adding-removing words from Dragon's written form/spoken form vocabulary listing, by asking the Dragon to take a look at more documents or emails, creating simple new commands that can be universal or application specific or using a full-fledged scripting language to produce more complex outputs from word commands. The user can also train the Dragon on specific words by speaking the word into the microphone and providing the associated spelling.

In addition, the Dragon has the ability to learn and improve its accuracy by periodically reviewing its past activities - there are several tasks that do that periodically while the user-focused portion of the Dragon is not running.

RIDING THE DRAGON

I confess that I was highly skeptical before trying this out. I expected a low word recognition rate, an unacceptable degradation in my laptop's performance and apps freezing or crashing while the Dragon was on.  I was proven wrong on all of the above.

My very first few sentences spoken into the Dragon were recognized 100% - I suppose the Dragon struggles hard to make a good first impression. Ever since, the Dragon's ability to recognize my commands as commands and execute them and to properly interpret my words stayed high enough. I am now comfortable to use the Dragon on all my casual emails (Gmail) and on my office emails (I do check before I say 'send' and I do enter the 'to' and 'cc' names manually), on all my instant text messages and on 'first draft' office documents.

Again, surprisingly, my computer did slow down appreciably with the Dragon on. This is only my subjective impression because Task Manager tells me that Dragon does take 30-60% of CPU while in listening mode. The good news is that it's easy to turn the Mic off when Dragon is not needed and then Dragon's CPU usage drops to 3-4%.

And there is no significant bad interaction with other apps that I'm aware of. I running the Dragon on a Windows 7, dual-CPU Thinkpad T40 and I haven't detected any 'new' problems following the Dragon installation.

THE DRAGON TRAINING/RIDING YOU

The Dragon does a lot to make itself useful and helpful. There is an optional sidebar that lists the most common commands available within the current context or you just say 'what can I say?' and the available commands show up, 'Help' pops up whenever you say 'give me Help', a brief tutorial with examples covers most activities, there is a Web site... and so on.

While the above paragraph could have fit under the Dragon Riding section and it's true that many serious apps provide that kind of help, the Dragon is unique in its training its users into gradually modifying the way their minds work. It's a gradual process but the fact that the longer the spoken piece is - the Dragon tries to make sense of what you said whenever you 'pause' - the more accurate the Dragon is at guessing what your really meant to say. In other words, the Dragon is gently training you into speaking in complete, well-structured sentences.

Speaking for myself, being the fast touch typist that I am, I tend to type first and complete my thought later - because I can quickly erase/rephrase my text. This approach does not work well with the Dragon - it's possible to correct and modify a text but it's not efficient. Like I said, I am currently comfortable with using the Dragon for quick emails and messages but not for 'serious' documents. I do notice that my Dragon-dictation skills are improving and more of my soundbytes are complete sentences.

MY RATING

The Dragon is one of the few pieces of computer software within this price range that does something useful and it does it intelligently. You can't have a conversation with the software the way you would with a typing clerk or a computer operator but, as the software evolves (I am reviewing Version 11) and as our little computers get faster and more capable, the Dragon seems to be very much on the path to that level of interactivity.

The way it is now, I will continue to use the Dragon. I don't expect for everybody to love it or 'like' it because it really depends. It does require some significant time investment to make it work well and... read the 'Dragon Riding You' section above. I personally like/love this software and, therefore, MY rating is a 5-star but, if I can recommend anything, it would be 'try it before you buy it'.

P.S. - I did NOT test Dragon's interaction with sound files or digital voice recorders.

"I have used Turbo tax for years and during that time I have also tried other products H+R, Jackson, blahblahblah.  I always go back to Turbotax, if you are not sure of anything it will walk you through, if you are comfortable with the software you can use the form straight from the software.  In the nutshell, this will get your taxes done quickly with the right forms and get you all set for your taxes.  Those of you who like to be ""creative"" with your taxes this will also tell you how much BS your filing and your chances of being audited.  The one thing I have noticed is that not all software can handle the states very well, people have complained about their state taxes being hosed somewhat.

Overall I give this a 5 star considering I could take my personal papers to a CPA, tax preparer, or try to hammer it out myself.  It cuts the time down to nothing, 2 hours and I'm done.

Just remember to update Turbo Tax after you install.",0
"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product.",0

"I used to swear by Norton Antivirus because in 2 years working for a government agency that will remain nameless in the early-mid 2000's their network went down 4 times and every computer on it was infected with a virus except for mine which I had uninstalled McAfee on and instead installed my own copy of Norton (though I'll never admit that to the system administrator).  But AVG blows Norton out of the water.  I started using it because everyone I know who works in IT (which is a lot since I work in IT) recommended it.  Now I swear by it because I have been virus free for 3 years running AVG just with the free version.  And the internet security features that the paid version offers are second to none!  Try it out for free at AVG's website if you like, but come back and buy from Amazon because they are cheaper (at least today they are) and you get a box and CD at no additional charge!",0

"Ive used McAfee for years.  Only once. . . several years ago. . . have I had an issue with it not catching something.  Granted, that was a HUGE hassle when it happened, but since then, I haven't had any issues, and I still use it.

If you look at the information above in the listing, you will see the comparison between this option and the Total Protection option.  They are very similar, though Total Protection gives you encryption, if thats something you need or are interested in.  Currently, they are the same price if you go the key code route.

Key Code:  You will be sent the code in the mail.  So depending upon your shipping option, you may have to wait a few days.

If you have used McAfee in the past, this product is very easy to add. You simply go into your online McAfee account and enter the information.  Then it will download and install.",0

"I have been using TurboTax for many years.  It is consistently easy to use, with the ""road map"" guiding the user through all the apprepriate steps.  The bulit-in segments on helping the user find deductions - and even estimating the value of non-cash donations - helps any user find everything they wish to include quickly with minimal fuss.
The program itself also looks just like it has for several years.  The only differences seem to be behind the screens, designed to make the system easy to use while constantly updating forms and calculations to match current IRS guidlines.  Highly recommended.",0

"Acronis used to make some great software. I've shelled out a couple of hundred bucks for their Disk Director Suite and TrueImage Backup. My PC - like many of the ones made today - uses SATA drives. SATA is the new generation of ultra-fast, huge capacity drives. Nowhere on the package or website is this mentioned: Acronis software does not support SATA drives! As soon as the software installation is completed - not during, no pre-test - after - you receive a warning that the software ""has detected unsupported hard drives"" - it won't do anything. The program runs, but you'll just keep receiving an error that ""No HDD detected"" and that's it. Since the software has been opened you can't return it.

Acronis? Lousy tech support. When they answer support emails (about  the time) it's ""this will be addressed in the next version"" - yes, but I paid for this version! ""sorry"" OK, next versions come out - version 11. Guess what? SAME PROBLEM! No support if your PC only has SATA drives!",1

"I'm not hugely experienced using Roxio Creator.  I've almost always had one version or another of Roxio Creator, and find that I mostly use it for converting my cd's to different audio formats for use on different devices, or for making fun cd's for the car of favorites.

I also tend to use it when making data cds as I can't find the software my laptop came with for doing that.  I can find this one every time and it is pretty easy to use.

As for use, it is fairly easy to use - you select what you want to do, then follow the steps.  I like that Roxio has made it so easy this way.

I didn't realize I could convert video specifically for my Kindle Fire, but Roxio makes that possible too - that is on my to-do list, but I haven't tested that section yet.

This is my go-to software for converting music and burning discs.",0
"Perfect for the amature video editor. Does many professional features in a simpler way for everyone to understand. A lot of the features like motion tracking for different things like censor bars or blurs work perfectly and are easy to set up to follow someone. This can be done with almost any video effect to spice up your videos and have them look somewhat professional. It's quite a nice piece of software. Very stable, hangs occasionally but never crashes and even if it does it autosaves frequently so your stuff will most likely be recovered. Had a little issue with video files becoming choppy during the editing process. It was solved by making sure all the video files were by enabling the smart proxy manager and adding all your project files to it. Really good software, love it.",0

It has the programs I wanted and will use.",0
"There may be some people out there that don't like QuickBooks, but I'm not one of them. Perhaps because my needs aren't as robust, but I don't experience any of the problems I've read about.

One thing off the bat: the QB methodology is way more intuitive to non-accounts than any other program I've used, which for me is a good thing: I'm not an accountant. Invoices, purchase orders, credits, payments etc are all easily entered and, more importantly, modified if need-be. I remember using a more traditionally set-up accounting program in the past and some of those operations were almost impossible to figure out (though as I said, for real accountants those programs may be more intuitive, and QB more frustrating).

Frankly, I haven't run into any problems that I couldn't figure out myself, and I've been able to get the program up and running exactly as I want it to run, quickly and easily. Any errors I've run into at all were quickly rectified by doing a database rebuild, so I've been quite happy.  Add to that the utter confusion I experienced using competing products and there's nothing out there that I'd rather use.

It may not be the be-all and end-all if you're an accountant, but I've yet to find anything that I want to do with it that I can't, and it's done everything I've asked without a hiccup. Considering what I used to pay my accountants in New York every month, this is a total winner.",0

"I was skeptical that an entry-level product would really allow me to create animations, but Anime Studio delivers the goods. It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

OK, now for my input device recommendation: Anime Studio has good drawing tools. Lots of animation work requires precise placement of points, drawing of paths, etc. You really want to use a tablet. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WACOM-CTE450K-Black-Bamboo-Fun-Tablet-with-Pen-Mouse-Graphics-Software-NEW/dp/B002QJASB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WACOM CTE450K Black Bamboo Fun Tablet with Pen, Mouse & Graphics Software (NEW)</a>&nbsp;is a perfect match for Anime Studio.

Best program for protection the computer with by Norton......,0
"As a Vista-fugue, the main reasons for even bothering with a `Bootcamp' Windows installation were Microsoft ""Office"" and Intuit's ""Quicken/Turbotax"", both richer-featured in their PC than in their Mac releases.  Disappointingly, iWork '08 'Pages' performed better as an image-based page layout package for the multimedia center crowd, proving woefully underpowered in a professional business office ... crippled by the tediously awkward conversion hassle from  *.doc to  *.pages documents.

No more!  With iWork '09, Apple has virtually erased any remaining barrier to business office `switchers' still on the fence.  I have explored and tested Pages '09 since its online release as a downloadable fully functional 30-day trial demo.  I was so impressed with the new Pages (as against the flashy eye candy of the '08 version) that I ordered the full boxed version.  [The trial software is well worth a test run to see if iWork meets your needs.)  The new Pages now easily exports a document in doc, txt or pdf format, and does a remarkably lifelike transformation of even highly complex Word documents, tables, lists, or legal briefs with a mere double-click or drag-and drop.

Rather than spreading myself too thin, I limit this review to `Pages', leaving commentary on `Numbers' to spreadsheet buffs ... `Numbers' capabilities, in the past, were no match for the depth of MS-Excel.  If  `Numbers`  performs as well as  `Pages'  in this  iWork  overhaul, then the product will be the best eighty bucks gift for your Mac.  `Keynote', an image-with-outline presenter's tool, probably will prove at least the equal of MS-PowerPoint considering the Mac's flair for spectacular graphics.

`Pages' well may be the impressive turnaround software that elevates the Mac from multimedia center toy to serious professional business status.  Highly recommended for Vista-weary PC users and Mac loyalists looking for a solid business suite.  The detailed crystal-clear manuals and crisp `Help' replies are welcome value-added resources.",0
"Not too long ago, I wrote a 20-page business plan just from scratch.  Maybe that was a good exercise but I'll never do it again.  It was too time consuming.  This software makes the job easy and dramatically reduces the time versus writing from scratch.

The time saved and professionalism in using this software even once will justify the investment.  After all, one does not write a business plan without intending to invest money in startup costs.

Another advantage is the completeness of a work product from Business Plan Pro 15th edition.  It's doubtful one would independently design a business plan that covers as much ground without this software.

I had always thought writing business plans was tedious and therefore many people simply have it in their heads.  It's mush wiser to generate a bone fide business plan, but use a software tool to save an incredible number of hours.  The interview process makes the job relatively painless although you still have to make decisions.",0
"After spending some time with iMovie '08 and writing a series of articles on it, I thought I'd use this week to explore Apple's Numbers '08, the newest addition to Apple's iWork '08 suite of office applications.

Now, I must admit upfront that I have little or no prior experience with spreadsheet applications. My basic numbers calculations have been done in programs like Quicken and the analog pen and paper method. I think in the past I may have opened up Excel or tried to use Apple's AppleWorks spreadsheet program, but not only did the programs look boring, but I had no idea where to begin in using these applications.

Leave it to Apple, however, to create yet another useful production program for the rest of us. That is, a program which is intuitive, practical, and stylish. Numbers '08 is another fine program that can help you transform the analog fashion of pen and paper calculations and create functions that can help you become more efficient with various projects involving money, data gathering and calculations.

Already I see a number of projects that I can create or improve upon using Numbers '08. For example, for the last couple of years I've been keeping a simple photography equipment inventory list in my business binder. When I make a new $[...]+ purchase I make note of it in my list. But with Numbers '08, I can streamline that data and keep a running balance on how much I've spent on equipment. Likewise, I can use the same technique for creating a better marketing plan, an equipment needs budget, a business growth plan, a couple of simple to-do check lists for long terms projects, and a few custom invoices for freelance work I do. In fact, I've already re-designed my wedding client contract using Numbers '08 so that I can use it on my laptop and fill it in right after the close of a sale. This type spread sheet method is more accurate and less time consuming than the paper format.

The templates that come installed with Numbers '08 provide a list of other possibilities that include various financial budgets plans, a home improvement plan, an event planner, grade book, and a science research report.

As with Apple's Pages and Keynote, Numbers '08 is also a graphic design application. It contains tools for adding various font styles, shapes, photos, and other media. In other words, you have the ability to tell a visual story with your facts, figures, and data.

If you have no prior experience with spread sheet creation or if you want to learn the features of Numbers '08, Apple has produced an excellent set of tutorial videos to get you up and running. The 286-page Numbers User Guide is also another useful source for getting started and learning the program.

The most challenging part for those of us new to spreadsheet development is understanding how formulas work in a table setup so that calculations can be made. Numbers '08 comes installed with over 150 formulas that will perform most all the calculations that we'll ever need. But the basic mathematical functions that you learned in high school should be enough to get your started. Basically, a formula simply provides the sum of selected cells in a table. Again, the Apple tutorial or User Guide and the installed templates will show you some really easy steps for basic functions. From there, you can study and create formula functions to fit your individual needs.

Already a third-party website called Numbers Templates has been created to share templates, tips, and tricks for using the Numbers '08 spreadsheet program.

Though I can't compare Numbers '08 with the industry standard program like Excel, Apple's program I think will fit the needs of most home and small business users. No doubt, future versions will include even more advance functions, but as with Apple's other fine programs, Numbers '08 has the simplicity and style that we've all come to expect.

"I've used various anti-virus/security software packages over the years (McAfee, Norton, etc).  There is no one software package that is going to catch everything but over the years I've gravitated toward Kaspersky products as doing the best overall job of catching as much as possible and not bogging down my computer.  Kaspersky Pure continues to work well for me in that regard.  I tend to be a cautious user so I don't pick up a whole of junk for Kaspersky to detect, but it has picked up things here and there.  I also run the free version of Malwarebytes software and to date it hasn't picked up anything additional beyond what KP already detected.  I also haven't had any software conflicts that sometimes arise between anti-virus software packages and the OS or other programs.  Pure does it's job and stays out of the way otherwise.

"This review is being written by someone who has never been mistaken for anything other than someone who can pick up a pen or pencil and scribble something. I cannot draw or make anything resembling a realistic visualized image that has been converted for other people to view. This program however allowed me to create realistic paintings that did a better job than my hand otherwise would have if someone were to give me a paintbrush.

I'm not saying this should take the place of paint and canvas or that it was the paintbrushes' fault. No but this program allows someone with no talent in this art form, like me, to be guided a little better to what fits me as I try to recreate anything on the screen.

For instance the multifarious functions that allow you to change which kind of stroke to use or the method of the stroke (watercolors, paintbrush, pencil) acted a portable art studio with everything at my disposal. I previously had no real knowledge of the different types of things that I could use. This program had it all in front of me (with help menus I might add) that taught me along the way as I learned to use this program.

I used just a mouse (no stylus) so my precision was probably hindered a bit, although I don't think having more control would have helped me much, remember I am not a visual artist. So in essence I'm speaking for people out there that want the bare minimum of this program in that you are buying solely the program itself.

Great aspects of program:
- Has every brush stroke I could think of, with all sizes and shapes to use in an instance
- Has a color palette allowing you to choose any color or mix thereof to suit your need
- Even with a mouse, I was able to create very succinct precision, surprisingly
- Acts as an art studio and art teacher, in that if you haven't caught on to how to make paintings through conventional means this program actually acts as a guide that may be easy to learn from then other forms

Obviously you know that this review is not for the professional for I am just an average everyday software junkie who has no knowledge or art or drawing or programs thereof. I can say, however, that this program was smooth to install, extremely easy to use and taught me some things about drawing on a computer I was never aware of. For that matter, it allowed me to do things with a ""virtual"" paintbrush I never thought I could do. So if there is a budding or curious artist in your, I suggest this program will get you there quicker than a complete art studio would. Of course you are saving much more money too.",0
"I love foreign languages. Whether or not I ever get to a foreign country, I delight in knowing other ways to say the same thing. Foreign languages are a brain stimulating way to entertain oneself. Unfortunately, many of the tools for learning are not affordable. Classes offered in the public schools often teach correct grammar but fall short of proving communication skills in a language. Along comes Instant Immersion and problems are solved! A friend of mine had taken Italian in school and writes to a cousin in Italy but was still missing a large skill set in learning the language of her ancestors.

Like a much more expensive software tool, Instant Immersion teaches large amounts of vocabulary and necessary phrases in a way that is hard to forget. The student can practice their skills through progressive challenges which lead them through  several levels of expertise. An added bonus is a fun game that skillfully reinforces what is being learned in a fun and stimulating way.

Why waste money on other product. Buy Instant Immersion and have moeny left over to learn other languages!",0

It's fairly easy to use as these types of programs go, and in fact I found it easier to use than Final Cut Express. My first impressions are good. This is a solid program for the price. I like it better than Final Cut Express but not quite as much as Vegas Pro. Incidentally, this is much cheaper than both. If you have a Windows PC and are just starting out with editing this is a solid choice.",0
"I switched from Norton IS back in 2004 and thought I would try PC-Cillin back then.  I gave it an OK rating based on some missing parts in PC-cillin internet security 2004.

Now however, it appears as though PC-cillin has the complete package and the memory footprint is still way below the other guys!

The 2 biggest features from 2004 are the ability to block URL's by type (i.e., guns, hate, adult) etc.  In the 2004 version you had to manually input each URL that you wanted blocked.  Finally! what a great upgrade.

The next most impressive upgrade is the WI-FI alarm for unauthorized uses on your network.  I love it!  I've often wondered if my network was getting leeched and now I will know for sure.  After a few clicks you can ""trust"" or ""untrust"" a device and make it so it will not be able to connect.

This years product seems to be a little more aggressive in the spyware category so that is also a bonus.

I was a very loyal Norton user 2 years ago and now I couldn't be happier I switched.  This product does it all and at about half the use of resources compared to Norton.

Well worth the upgrade if you have WI-FI, a network, or just want the latest and greatest.",0

So far I'm very enthusiastic.  And since I've also heard the telephone help has been improved, it feels like I'm going to get very comfortable using Norton exclusively for all my computers.",0
"I tend to be long-winded in my reviews ... but there's just not much more to say here than, ""It's cheaper than PhotoShop, and gives you mostly the same experience.""  It's certainly less intimidating than PhotoShop, and while a pro photographer or graphic designer might find some things lacking, the not-so-pro graphic designer (me) couldn't find any.

In fact, I have a commercial license for PhotoShop and FireWorks at work, and use this at home because I'm trying to get more done on a budget, and for me it works great.

I seriously think this is Microsoft's best operating system ever. I still has some minor flaws, but it is very fast, and finds the right drivers. I recently added a parallel port by PCI Express. I restarted, entered the bios, saved changes, and booted into Windows 8. Then I went into the device manager, parallel port, properties, and changed the port settings from LPT-3 to LPT-1 where it is supposed to be. I turned on my old HP Laserjet 5, and plugged in the cable while Windows 8 was running. Down on the taskbar, Windows was loading the right drivers for that 20 + year old printer. Take the time to learn 8, and it will out perform 7, 3 to 1. It even downloads my I Phone, and 7 would not.",0
"I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve! I typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on April 14, and if it wasn't for the simplicity fo this software, I'd be filing extentions every year. Really, gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part. This software does everything else for you.",0
"This product is a no-brainer. I have used Norton consistently for the last 10 years and it's the only product (I've used MacAfee, Kapersky and others), that has kept my PCs--and now phone and tablets--free from viruses. The best!",0
ok,0
Know that there is an update to the v. 11 so that when you install you'll want the update before playing. Have enjoyed the versitility of the Tab and Custom selections and the Blu Ray is working fine. Use with Windows7 and 64 bit.,0
"I have used many other big name internet security suites over the years but prefer Kaspersky and will pay for it out of pocket even though my internet provider is offering McAffe for free. It has always done a great job of keeping viruses and malware out of my system when others have let things through only to find them during a full system scan.
In addition to a full system scan there is a quick critical scan that checks items loaded at start up and a vulnerabilities scan that will check your system and applications for security vulnerabilites and recommend setting changes or other fixes. There is also a drop box on the scan screen where you can drop a single file you would like to scan.
It also has a safe-run reature you can use when visiting sensitive sites like banking for an added layer of security. Network monitor, Virtual keyboard, Applications activity. Tools like creating a bootable rescue disk, parental controls, Windows settings troubleshooting, Internet Explorer security setting configuration.
A great value.",0

"H&R block still leads the pack with their tax software.  Based on Kiplinger's Tax Cut and many new versions since then, this is easy, fast and reliable.

Even for small business owners, for itemizing deductions, and other one off credits and deductions, the software collects the information and checks it against tax laws and lets you know when a certain deduction, credit, depreciation is or is not applicable for your specific return.",0

"For those who have the software and like printing their own checks, it is hard to beat this huge pack of check paper. For a laser printer, they work well with the correct software. They do not have pictures on them, as I feared. Instead, they are just blank pages with a nice subtle bank-like non-forgery design on the whole page.",0
"Again this year we used H&R Block software to file our taxes.  We file our own taxes, and then assist our mothers with filing their own (easy retiree returns).  We've never had a problem with the software -- we itemize and use quite a few of their forms.  We don't qualify for the online ""free e-files"" that are always advertised, so this is a very reasonable alternative.
We downloaded the state program for our state, and it was missing one of the forms we needed.  I was able to download it from the state's website.  Our state doesn't allow e-filing (so weird, and seemingly last century) so we have to print it out and mail it in anyway.
As long as they don't make any major changes, or raise the price, we'll be back next year to buy the 2016 version.",0

"I've recently been reading a ton of complaints around the web about the Symantec Norton Antivirus and Internet Security Suite of software. The following little review has been written in response to those complaints:

One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.

With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.

Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec. Nevertheless, despite these pitfalls, as long as I can keep upgrading for free and my systems remain virus-free, Norton is my source for internet security.

I used this program because I am comfortable with it.  I can't say if it is any better or worse for anyone else.  I once got a free copy of Turbo Tax after doing my tax return and had enough confidence to not bother to see if the more expensive Turbo Tax produced any different results.  Most of us do not have very complicated tax returns but using a program like this reduces math errors.,0
"For the price, I doubt you can do better than this.
From your smartphone to laptop to tablet, Norton 360 offers nice protection on an assortment of devices. I did NOT install on a laptop running Windows 8, as it looks like those bugs might not have been worked out, but the same can be said for Windows 8 itself. Very good value.",0
"Please be aware that the vast majority of the reviews for this product are false and probably written by employees of the competing product. Ok enough of that, lets get to this product.

We use this for our business and sofar have been very happy with this product. Sure there are some times the program offers services that are not included and probably should have been. It is very easy to use and a complete solution for our company. The other competing products are more aggressive with offering paid for addons. Sage 50 is more matter of fact when they offer them so its a bit more palatable. Our accountant loves this program because he uses it every day. I use it to check the reports he generates. We can import CSV files into the program fairly easily and this allows for faster integration of our data.

Pros:
+ Easy to use
+ Easy to install
+ Import data easily
+ Nice looking reports
+ Mostly complete

Cons:
- Payroll addon (come on shouldnt these be included???)
- Other addons that should also be included for the price.

Overall we will continue to use this software. The other alternative is just not worth the hassle and aggressive tactics.

Thanks for reading my review.",0

"I absolutely enjoyed using Sony Movie Studio 13 suite.  It installed without any grief and was intuitively simple to use considering I've used several similar applications and am becoming increasingly skilled with many apps included within my Adobe CC subscription.

Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite is aimed for the audience who is more into social media (it's very easy to share completed videos directly to FB!)  If you don't need some less used pro level tools of Premiere Pro (and After Effects), and want to OWN the software instead of leasing it at approximately $50 / month, then Sony Movie Studio is definitely worth a consideration.

The included Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 is an added bonus for editing, mixing and blending audio tracks. The vocal eraser allows karaoke tunes to be created from more traditional audio sources.  My audiophile spouse was VERY pleased with the audio recording and editing ability - not exactly my area of expertise, but if he's happy then I'm happy.",0
"I really like using this program. I used to work on Windows with Office XP, Office 2003, Office 2007, and [...], but this program, however different, was intuitive enough for me to get right to work. (I've also used Office 2008 for Mac more recently, but I don't like it as much.)

Everything looks elegant, effects (like slide transitions in Keynote) are totally cool (way better than in Office), it's really easy to use, it has really good performance, it's actually fun to use, and I'm always finding new cool things to do with it. Like control Keynote with the Apple remote or make a flash website out of a Keynote presentation (and yes, there are similar features in Office, but Office doesn't perform well enough and it's not fun enough to experiment in). You can even make 3D graphs that look like real materials or draw vector graphics almost as well as in Inkscape or Illustrator. And the list goes on and on, it's really nice to use.

Office compatibility is just 'okay'. It works, but when you import a Word document, for example, you're going to have to manually fix things like picture location or page boarders. Using Keynote to open a PowerPoint won't import transition sounds. But I noticed that even Office 2008 won't look the same as documents viewed in Office 2003. PowerPoint files are best viewed in Office 2008, but Pages opens .doc files BETTER than Office 2008, I noticed. Excel compatibility is fine.

I can't go though everything I like about the program in one review, but you can download the trial from Apple so there you go. I would highly recommend trying iWork 08.",0

"I am using Microsoft Office 2003 Professional Enterprise edition, obtained through an MSDN subscription.
Microsoft Office System 2003 will prove to be the best in its class. The Microsoft Office Family has been revamped to provide industry standard XML and .NET support. Files can be easily shared between applications in the Office System family.
Microsoft Office now includes a new research tool that allows you to easily search for information. You can search research books (thesaurus, dictionaries) and web resources. Third party developers are creating even more sources (like Google) that will make this an essential tool for anyone writing reports.
Microsoft Outlook has been revamped with a new and improved interface. It is now easy to categorize messages, calendar items, contacts and more. These items can then be sorted by category! Outlook 2003 is easier to use than any previous version.
Microsoft Office 2003 is a complete solution for the home and business user alike. It is an essential tool for students and developers. The wave of the future is XML and Microsoft is beginning to shape that future today.
If you are new to Microsoft Office this is an essential product. This is a nice upgrade from Office 2000 or XP, but mostly for developers and businesses. If you want to harness the power of XML or .NET this is for you.
Microsoft Office System 2003 will only run on systems with Windows 2000 or XP installed.",0
"Here's a simple, straightforward review.

I have used Cyberlink products for at least the last 5-10 years. I have always thought the software does what it says it will do and is easy in doing it. PowerDVD 13 continues the tradition.

Installation (on a Win7 64-bit HP ProBook) was a breeze: stick the CD in and follow instructions. Done.

Using the program was equally easy. First you enter the supplied product key. Once activated (internet connection required) the welcome screen offers an option to see some tutorials on the Cyberlink website (the package also includes a printed manual that is well-written, easy to understand, and helpful [but I'm not so sure you will even need the manual]). Once you get to the main screen it will tell you either to insert a BluRay (or DVD) or click on ""play.""

It's that easy. Really. Not kidding.

5 stars.

"I'm still working through the basics. So far, this is an awesome package. Chinese is tough because of the strange alphabet and the language is totally different from English. Even though I have a busy schedule, I'm still able to learn Chinese bit by bit in the time that I do have. This is an expensive package, but worth it. It's nice to be able to go at your own pace. I would not call myself intellectual, but Rosetta Stone makes learning languages a fun hobby.

Included in this package are:
* printed manuals (very nice - a lot of software packages neglect these)
* software CDs for all 3 levels
* audio companion CDs for all 3 levels
* USB headphone and microphone set

The software allows you to focus on the aspects of the language you want to learn first and provides you a total immersion environment. Rather than dull repetition, the software guides you through the learning process with related graphics so you see & hear the words at the same time.

Even with all the goodies, the work isn't done for you, as with anything if you want to learn it, you do have to put some effort into it.",0

For the vast, vast majority of users this software will be sufficient for video editing. I think this program is a great place to start for any beginner or intermediate level editor. You can always upgrade to Final Cut or Adobe later if your needs outpace this software. In the meantime, this is a solid program for a great price and I highly recommend it.",0
"This is the second game in the Nancy Drew software series that I've tried (I've also played ""Message In a Haunted Mansion""), and this was by far the more difficult of the two.  In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from ""The Secret of the Old Clock"", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on ""Display"", then clicking on the ""Settings"" tab, then clicking the ""Advanced..."" button, then clicking the ""Performance"" tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to ""Full.""  Then you'll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!  All in all, this is a very fun game for teenage girls and young women (and hey, guys too!), great for friends and family members to play together, and just an all-in-all wonderful game.  I hope Dreamcatcher and HER Interactive make more of these!",0
"I already have the Spanish version of Rosetta Stone, but we are planning a trip to Italy (hopefully) this fall, so I jumped on a recent offer to try out the Italian version, too. (Please see my review of the Spanish version, as well.)

I find the software incredibly intuitive to learn and use, and while there's a LOT of review, it definitely drums things into your head. I also like the diversity used in the photos -- OK, sometimes it's a little surprising to have a picture of a man who's clearly Central Asian when you're in the middle of your Italian lesson, but people from all ethnicities speak all different languages in this jet-setting world, so I guess it really shouldn't seem all that unusual!

One relatively minor complaint: Both my husband and I have had some issues with the headset. Sometimes we've found ourselves shouting into it in Italian, trying to get it to pick up our words. Other times, we're positive that we're pronouncing the words correctly, but it doesn't think we are. The one that came with my Spanish set seems to work better than the one that came with the Italian set, for some reason. Considering the cost of the program, a more reliable headset would be nice.

A word about the audio companions -- they're very handy, but they will NOT work on their own. We find them useful mostly for when we're driving and want to practice a bit. I particularly like to use them to keep me from forgetting what I've learned when I haven't had a chance to use the software for a little while.",0
I installed this on my Macbook Pro without problems. I was leery it would slow my computer but it has not reduced speed of start up or performance. It didn't find any viruses or mal ware so I will have to wait to see if it catches anything. But at least I have the assurance that I have a security system in place. I will update at a later date.,0
"Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.",0
"Windows XP home is a operating system from Microsoft that finally defines stability and ease of use into one. If you are thinking about upgrading from Windows 98, go straight ahead, if you are still using Windows ME, please immediately upgrade. This operating is very easy to use with a redesigned start menu that provides easier access to programs and accessories. More stable because it is built upon the Windows NT kernel so it won't crash but your applications will software apps weren't built on NT, only the Operating System, so you can't get everything perfect! But this operating system is really worth the buy you won't regret it trust me. With soft edged Windows and rich icon pictorials this operating system really makes digital media a lot of fun. Plus the multi-user settings in Windows XP makes it a good purchase, so everyone in the family can have their own settings without interupting other peoples files and  personal settings. People have been asking Microsoft for years to merge both the ease of from 98 and the stability of NT, now they have it, why not take it. And their just too many features to talk about here! Trust me you won't regret it.",0

"Look, I could write a review that tries to coddle those who are having a problem with this McAfee Virus Scan program, but for me, it is like finally arriving after a sea of disappointments. (I am talking about McAfee VirusScan Plus 2008-3 User Newest Version) Make sure you remove all other antivirus programs, and firewalls first before loading this McAfee Virus application. I have never seen an antivirus program that works properly with a 2nd antivirus program loaded at the same time.
It includes a Security Center, Virus Scan, Personal Firewall, Easy Network, and Site Advisor.

First of all forgive me for writing such a long review, but there is a lot of ground to cover. For those who like the short version, with less information here it is: Norton slowed my DSL connection down by a third. I spent a day with Verizon, couldn't figure out why all of my other machines in the network were getting 756k, and this one got only 4 or 500 tops. Then I removed Norton, and bingo, instant 756k. AVG free edition is nice but takes a lot of boot up time while it updates upon every single boot up, unless you disable that feature, then it sends out your Outlook email with a message that your antivirus is out of date, and this email could be dangerous, or something like that. Zone Alarm used to be the best, now they are nearing the worst. My Windows 2000 machine went blue screen after an update, took me 2 days to figure out that was the problem, so I removed it after discovering the problem in a forum, and it solved it. Also ZA after recommending it to my friend, would not work at all in a Windows XP Media Center machine. Ask ZA and they say they no longer support it in Media Center. 50 bucks down the drain. Now it takes my XP regular edition SP2 well over 5 minutes to boot with Zone Alarm Security Suite, and I mean WELL over 5 minutes; it's ridiculous. I removed it to load this McAfee Virus Scan (MVS), and the machine immediately booted in only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to the point I was able to bring a Google page up. So I loaded this MVS and the machine booted in only 2 minutes and 45 seconds, once again to a Google page appearing. In both cases I clicked on a Google desktop icon as soon as it appeared, and then waited for the results. It clicks, goes dark blue, and waits for everything else to load, including MVS before it will allow a page to appear. So MVS took only 30 additional seconds to load, and according to Scotty the watchdog in WinPatrol, it loads about 7 .exe files. So that is fast. Now that is with a machine that is loaded up with a ton of programs.

I first loaded MVS in my home office machine, in the same network, with the same configuration, Asus A8N SLI, AMD 64 3200+, 1Gb ram. The home office machine with MVS loaded, gave me the same results but in approximately one minute before I could get a Google page up. (This is an edit, I actually timed the boot up, and not counting the time to type in my password, it booted in exactly 42 seconds) Boot up to Google in only a minute with MVS, and in 2 minutes and 45 seconds in my overloaded machine that used to take well over 5 minutes with Zone Alarm. I'm sold.

While performing a scan it did not affect the performance of the machine, either in surfing the web, or opening programs, even the intensive programs like Dreamweaver MX 2004, or Photoshop CS2.

When loading do as the quick start guide says, put in the CD, then choose the option of loading from the web. It's a 45 Meg download, but it's the latest.

Manage network feature, it recognized all of the other machines, and components with an IP address in my network. It recognized my Windows Server 2003 R2 Edition, but gave me a status message of a request to upgrade to an operating system of at least W2000 or later. I guess that is because of W2003 security, blocking scans.

Before I even acquired MVS I did not understand exactly what they meant by the 3 user allowance, and couldn't find anything on it, so I want to share that with you. Did they mean that you could load it on one machine sharing a network, and then scan individual drives across the network, the same way early ZA did, or does this mean you can put it in more than one machine for full protection at all times. Fortunately it means the latter. I loaded it in the home office machine, registering it in my name to be able to get virus updates, and created a user name and password. Then I went into the other machine, dropped in the CD, did a complete install, but when the registration page came up, I logged in instead, and it instantly completed the registration for me, reminding me of my user name and password, and congratulating me on the installation. So it is a 3 machine complete install, that is cool, or should I say way cool.

I know this isn't about MVS but I advise you to get a free copy of CCleaner from the web. (Google it.) It cleans all the junk out of your computer and you can run it quickly before entering sensitive password sites for example. It cleans out your cache, cookies, etc. in only a few seconds. When you run it for the first time, it will take several minutes to remove it all, for example a ton of web pages you have been surfing, that your machine checks first, before drawing it from the distant server. A slooooow way for your machine to have to work.

McAfee has been around for a zillion years, they have been a leader, and from the performance of this product so far, they have totally aced it. You can see all of the other antivirus and firewall programs I have tried, and this one according to boot up time, and scan speed is the best. It scanned my office machine quickly, although I did not time it accurately. It scanned several gigs of data in what seemed like 10 minutes. My other machine with 230 Gigs of data takes about 5 hours with Zone Alarm, because I am using their older 7.0 version, it took 3 times that long with their newer version that works with Vista and XP. I am using it on an XP machine. Once again, had to get rid of the update, and go back to an earlier version.

Look I can't speak for everyone, or everyone's machine, but all I know is I am totally impressed with this McAfee product, and hope and pray they don't go down the tubes like Norton, and Zone Alarm did. (I have not used any recent Norton products, but Norton was the best when Peter Norton was there solving the DOS problems, almost like a miracle man, then from about 10 years ago, everything of theirs I tried was junk.) Sorry for the pointed remarks, but sometimes you find a product, after spending years in frustration, or at least you find something that works, then it goes bad, and finally, finally, something that really works great like this MVS. For me, my hat is off to McAfee. 150 Stars and counting. Highly recommended to say the least.
PS: I noticed another reviewer was having problems logging onto online acounts, so I put it to the test, logged into my bank account, which is a 3 step process, and also my online server, and did not have any problems. If I have any, or notice anything after using this product more, I will come back and edit the review. All of the essentials place this one at the top for now.",0
What can you say great product.,0
"Norton is THE BEST when it comes to internet security.  This particular product gives you 3 licenses, which you know you're eventually going to want another license if you buy computers often, so I definitely recommend going ahead and getting the 3 pack like this.  Norton has prevented several viruses from infecting my computer.  When I've tried competitors they've let things through.  I also love the Norton 360 for the password management system, which keeps track of all your passwords even across computers.  It really is a game-changing product.  I would not own a computer without Norton installed on it.",0

"This is my fourth year using TurboTax Home & Business. I love it. When I first started using it, I found I could use it to fill out city tax form. All the forms I have needed are supplied by TurboTax. It's cheaper than paying a tax preparer. I used an accountant to do my taxes the first year I went into business. I wanted to deduct something that he wouldn't deduct and he deducted something I didn't approve. I didn't realize it until after I filed. He charged me $500. Had I done it myself with TurboTax I could have received a much larger refund and could have saved on the cost of doing my taxes. I think TurboTax is Awesome.",0
"I was anxious to get started so I chose the electronic download. After installation, I updated to the latest version. Three hours later, I had edited 4 hour long videos and burned each to DVD. Very smooth operation, yet many options are available that I haven't even gotten to try out. I'll be honest, the machine I'm using this software on was designed and built to take advantage of multi-threaded processing/rendering and it has preformed most efficiently. I believe my opinion of this software will grow even more positive with use and becoming more familiar with many of its undiscovered options.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Update: I began to read reviews on the newest version (X7) and decided to upgrade. The results are even better as this version
is built around the 64 bit architecture for those who have 64 bit machines. I was a bit confused because Corel indicated this will work with 32 bit or 64 bit machines yet the electronic download from their site clearly separates the two. My assumption would be that the retail package would contain both iterations. This X7 version definitely takes advantage of today's hardware because the processing, rendering and burning all increase substantially. Although I'm still a fan of version X6, kicking it up notch (X7) was worth the price.",0
"This is not an in depth review. I've just started with the Rosetta Stone Chinese. I know it will be year or maybe even never, that I will be fluent in this lanuage.

I'm comfortable with their methodology and know that if I'm willing to put the effort in, on a regular basis, I can get to a decent level of proficiency in a new language in a year's time. Now a decent level of proficiency is not the same as fluent but it's worthwhile if your interest is in learning.

If you want to learn to read, write, speak, and understand a foreign language, and you're willing to dedicate regular daily time to do so, I don't think you'll find a better self study program available than Rosetta Stone.",0

"No problems at all.  I have had dragon for mac and dragon for PC.  I got this product for free -- and probably wouldn't have bought it, because the older versions worked, but were klunky.
This is a better version, and I use it on my desktop MAC.  I took off my headphones and set them on the desk, had a phone conversation on my cell -- ooops, my whole conversation was transcribed!
It works well, no problems.  I only use it to ""write text"" into word; I find it easier to just point and click to do other things.  No complaints, even with the Mac version.  It is worth the purchase.",0
"I have been using Power Director for years, through all its incarnations. I looked forward to Power Director Ultimate 12 for its promised speed and versatility. I use it to create home videos and my video reviews -- mostly video reviews.

Years ago, Power Director frustrated me with stalling and crashing. It also took forever and a day to render anything. I have seen great improvements in that area, and now it's wonderful. Whereas Power Director 10 would occasionally crash when I added voiceover, I've had no such problems with version 12 working on Windows 7. No crashing, no nothing. It's smooth sailing all the way.

The GUI is similar to previous versions, so I'm quite familiar. If you haven't used it before, there is a learning curve, but I remember taking to it very quickly. I like having all the different tracks to layer my effects. It's simple and intuitive. The video stabilization works so much better now. I couldn't believe how well it performed. Rendering is super fast. I can crank a video out with hardly a wait.

The only thing I miss is the old Magic Movie Wizard. Back in version 6, I could choose all the photos and videos in my library, choose the length of my piece and the music, then let the wizard work. It really was magic. Photos and videos were randomly selected and pieced into a masterpiece which I could then alter. The latest versions of Power Director took that all away and now puts every bit of film clip and photos that we choose into the video in the exact order that they are in the library. No random selection, no mixing them up for the magic. I liked how it was in version 6. If they could undo any improvements to Power Director, that would be it.

There are so many features now, it would be impossible to review them all. I do like the speed and the ease of manipulating the videos. I like how it's easy to align the clips with the effects and the sound and subtitles. I like how quick it is to undo something I don't like. We've always been given lots of choices in what format we want to produce the video. We still have that and sometimes I use it to simply convert a video into another format.

So far, so good. Version 12 is a winner.

UPDATE 2/24/14: I finally got the chance to use the multi-cam feature. I filmed scenes using two camcorders at once (we can use up to four). Then, I synced them and switched back and forth between close-ups and wide shots. This was for a music video for my daughter's scout group. I couldn't believe the results. I couldn't believe I did it! It was so professional. What a wonderful piece of software.",0

"There is a small army of people who, like the recalcitrant insurgents in Iraq, will do anything to try to destroy Microsoft's reputation.  I'm not here to defend the biggest software company in the world.  As with any company, it makes some great products, many good products, and some bad products.

I did not upgrade to Microsoft Money 2004 because, sometime in 2003, my Money file developed some kind of minor corruption (""This operation cannot be performed"" error after entering certain types of transactions), and Money 2004 refused to even read the file.  This time, I downloaded the trial version of Money 2005, and it loaded the old-format file without a hitch.  And the mysterious error message is no more!

Money is cool because it makes it easy to keep track of your accounts, esp. for someone like me with dozens of banking and brokerage accounts (many from the days of Internet bubble when banks were giving away free money for opening accounts -- I knew I needed a real job...).  It's generates useful reports to track your networth, by category or over time.  Even for someone like me with lots of small accounts but little to show in the aggregate, it's immensely useful.

Should you get Money 2005, or upgrade from an earlier version?

I can't really help you with that question.  But I do have a couple suggestions:

1) Download the 30-day trial copy of the program from Microsoft's website and give it a test drive.  I tried it on my two laptops and both copies worked perfectly, which led me to doubt the truthfulness of a lof of these reviews from so-called ""I'm not anti-Microsoft"" people.  (No, yours truly doesn't work for Microsoft or get paid by them in any way.)

2) For a peace of mind, make a manual backup copy of your existing Money file in Windows Explorer.  Just go into My Computer or Windows Explorer, find the Money file (it's usually in ""My Documents""; its extension is "".mny""), and use copy-and-paste to make a copy.  Keep the backup copy in a different folder.  Better yet, zip the backup copy for extra security. :)

Try the program and judge for yourself if it works fine on your PC.  Not all the naysayers are liars, no doubt.  But, as I always advice my friends when they ask about gadgets, movies and whatnot, always try it yourself and form your own opinions.",0

Excellent OS Very stable. I have a copy running non stop for 1.5 years with no reboots. i will be rebooting it soon so i can do all the latest updates. For games it runs just fine. Don't be fooled and go with XP. Stick with WIndows 2000 Pro and save your money.,0
"I took the leap today and installed Windows 8 Pro. I didn't do a clean install due the complex system I have and the number of programs and hardware that would have to be re-installed. I chose the upgrade from Windows 7, keeping existing settings and files. This process took longer almost 55 minutes. The install asked one question, uninstall MS Security Essentials? The anti-virus is now part of the OS. I did the whole install within Windows 7. Upon completion Metro appeared, when I flipped to my desktop it was as the same original 7. Wallpaper, folders and programs were all there. MS Office, Chrome and Firefox. IE10 is remarkably fast. So far I'm extremely pleased, almost high.",0
I've used Turbo Tax many many times.  It's the best out there. I used it last year and will use it next year.  It stores your data and makes life easier. It autopopulates your information into each field the following year.  It's taxes for dummies truly. I adore this software and will never go to anything else.,0
"This was our first experience with Rosetta Stone for any language, and we were excited to get right into it and see if it lived up to expectations. Installation and setup of the program took a little while but completed without a hitch, and everything functioned properly right off the bat.
The immersive learning process is truly wonderful, and even our seven year old is able to participate and learn without having to worry about it being too complicated to use. Personally, I've almost completed the entire course and I've found that I've learned quicker and easier with Rosetta Stone than I did in my entire two years taking Spanish in high school (after which I still had only mastered the basics). The native speakers method of compare/contrast to your own speech is really what makes this program so special, and probably why it's more effective than just learning from a high school teacher saying the words and having you write them down.
Overall, I cannot speak highly enough of this product. I recommend it to anybody who's interested in learning Spanish, whether for your career, travel, or just to broaden your language horizons.",0

"The Essentials edition of Family Tree Maker came with everything that we needed to get started discovering our family's roots.  With some planning beforehand, the one-month trial of Ancestry.com was all that we needed to gather that source information.  The Family Tree Maker software integrates nicely with the site and then provides lots of easy, step-by-step methods for maintaining, organizing and viewing your results.  Several members of our household have tried it out and all indicated that they liked its interface and simplicity.  We installed it on Windows 7 with no issues.",0
"This product was made exclusively for the Mac from the ground up, but with its slick black glossy interface palettes it looks like it is running on Vista.
Aside from that, this program is great! For those who think IPhoto is severely limited and don't want to spend what you need to spend for Photoshop, Pixelmator is a great alternative at such a low cost. For those who are familiar with the photoshop interface, you might find the one in Pixelmator eerily similar. You will notice the tools palette on the left and the layers on the right. I am an artist by no means, but I enjoy manipulating my photos with this program with ease. It has over 130 filters which you can see the results in real time before applying, great color correction tools, and it exports in a large variety of formats. You can even take a picture using your Isight camera and add it as a layer in your picture.

Like I said before, I am no artist, and this program is great for the average to advanced user who does not need everything that Photoshop has to offer. You can tell that the makers of this program did their homework and took full advantage of the best features of Photoshop and included here int his program at such a moderate price. For those who decide to eventually get Photoshop, Pixelmator is a great tutorial to practice on. Though the way some of the tools operate differ somewhat from photoshop such as the magic wand and the rubber band like tool used to adjust some of the filters the overall effect is the same and top notch.

I think this program is well worth the money, and hey you can try it before you buy it at the Pixelmator website, so don't take my word for it, try it yourself!",0

"Art and I have a passing acquaintance. I appreciate art but have little ability. My children, however, enjoy creating all types of art and seem to go through a lot of ink, brushes, and paper/canvas. When paired with a Wacom tablet, this fantastic program encourages creativity.

Within minutes of setting up the program and Wacom tablet on my daughter's computer, she created a brush painting of a pomegranate. It was quite good and similar to the real brush painting she worked on with her art teacher. The difference is she could easily erase parts that were a little off and quickly redraw the sections. She is still getting used to the Wacom pen but already sees the potential of this program. I think she sometimes did not just pick up a brush and draw because she did not want to ""waste"" canvas or paint. I told her not to worry about it, but this is completely not a concern with digital art.

For myself, I have an interest in fountain pens and calligraphy. I tried the calligraphy pen and see the benefit of practicing with this program, but the pen does not have the same feel as my custom turned fountain pens. There are other brushes and pens that I have not tested. I did just purchase a set of different Wacom tips to see how they feel and respond.

I originally chose this program hoping it could turn photographs into art. It easily does this. In fact, it is so simple to use that I am becoming more creative with my photos and am experimenting with processing near infrared photos, bypassing my usual Corel Paintshop (or Adobe Photoshop Elements) drawn out routines. Painter does have a large learning curve, but it is worth the effort.",0

"The very first time I played this game (waaay back when it was first released), I found myself incapable of finishing it because I was just too scared. Please, if anyone scares easily, know this: This is not a scary game. It has it's wonderful spook elements, but the game overall isn't terrifying. It's actually really beautiful. Especially when you start getting near to the end.

To people looking to buy: There is an interesting historical level, the characters are all interesting, the setting is gorgeous (though now you can really tell that the graphics are dated, but that's ok), and all the loose ends are tied up. Also, you really get an interesting look into the past with this game.

I would not suggest this for people who get bored easily or are impatient because this game does take a bit of digging, and, as the title of this review states, it's not the most riveting game out there. You are stuck out on Moon Lake, which has a very small population of three people and you at this point. But it does have a lot of places to unlock, which is something I like in my games (finding new areas as the game progresses, rather than everything being handed to you upfront). Not that games that don't have secret passages aren't as good, they can be great too. I just get a little tingly 'I'm an adventurer' feeling when I find places that no one has seen in decades (or centuries, in some games). It's those little moments that make this such a great game.",0

UPDATE I installed this on my 64bit OS and soon received a message from the developer informing me that I need to discontinue Win cleaner on the 64bit OS.

Side Note...MS is really getting to be pain in my butt! UPDATE Wincleaner is a type of software that gets well...stolen. My KAV burned me and I in the end nuke the drive. I asked the software developer if I could have another shot at loading the software because unlike modern software that has the ability to recognize that it is back on the same computer (FAIR USE CLAWS) this software will not recognize the fact the it's reinstalled on the same computer.

"Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.",0

"This is actually a really great product... I was not expecting it to be as useful as it ended up turning out to be. I installed this on my wife's car (with her knowledge) in order to get an idea of how this worked. After a few days, we looked through the data and were amazed at how accurate the reports were. It gave detailed accounts of where she had been, how long, and how she drove. I had complained to her for years that she breaks too hard and to our surprise, the software claimed the same thing! Overall, she ended up with an 80% safety rating. She had one issue where she went to Virginia Beach and got lost... I was able to pull up the AwareGPS software, pinpoint exactly where she was, and direct her on the route to get home. Really amazing...

Two weeks into the use, my wife called to inform me she thought her battery was dying, and that it was difficult to start her car that morning. I pulled up the AwareGPS website and was able to see that her car was sitting in her workplace parking lot, and the battery was a bit low. I told her I'd keep an eye on it and after a couple of hours it dropped below 12v. I was able to call and warn her so that she could go out and start it up to recharge the battery. In the end, this device definitely saved her from having a issue as she was able to get over to the dealer that day and have the battery replaced.

Overall, it gives a good, detailed account of the car's trips, location, and status, as well as how well the driver is driving. It turned out incredibly useful in just the first month for a private user... can't imagine how useful it would be to a company who needs to keep track of their drivers and vehicle.",0
"I have children 14, 11, and 9, and I was looking for software that would appeal to their creative side.  I am a fairly sophisticated software user, and used to do some programming myself, but had never really ventured into these type of painting/art programs.

Bottom Line: I was blown away by this program, totally impressed!!

Why?

#1 It's easy to use out of the box--- many of the controls are easy enough to figure out just by using them, it installs easy on both Mac and PC systems (I installed the program on both an old eMac and a low end Vista laptop successfully).

#2 It's really powerful--- once you really get into the software, it's amazing all the different brushes and textures and effects that you can do to make really impressive art.

#3 The tutorials are first rate--- A thick instruction manual that actually is well written, and actually teaches you about basic principles of art and painting.  There are also a whole series of video tutorials included free.  You can tell that a lot of hard work and frankly a lot of love went into this, which is a rarity for computer software these days.

#4 It's a great value--- For all you get, the price is very reasonable.  And check the company's website, if you're still not sold they were at the time of this writing offering a 60 day free downloadable trial.

One more tip:  Get even a low-price graphics tablet to go along with the software--- you'll be glad you did!",0

"Easy ""drag & drop"" install and works well.  Running it on a 2010 era MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory.

Seems to be much improved over the earlier pre-VM4 versions.  Pricing is also very good, but you'll have to go out and buy a copy of Windows 7 which isn't cheap.  Microsoft sells their OS for much higher pricing than Apple.  However, if you have an old copy of the Windows XP install CD around, you can use that to install Win XP and then use a much cheaper license for Microsoft's Windows 7 ""Upgrade"" CD to bring it up to the latest Microsoft OS.",0

"Got this for my 14 year old who loves making cool edits to pictures of his favorite athletes, then sharing with friends and posting online.  He was able to use a copy of Photoshop while he was taking a graphics course in school, but as that class is over, I thought this would be a good replacement.

So far, he's said it was easy to install, and found it fairly intuitive to figure out how to find what he wants to do.  He likes the bitmap to vector feature (TRACE) as he's able to copy images he finds places and add them to his finished product, often greatly increasing their size without any loss of quality.

He has just started using this product so not sure about the special effects he is used to v what is available but he seems to think from cursory review that it has a rich set of effects.

I like that it's a permanent license, something uncommon in software today. I also like the videos that help you get started.

Instead of me going through the specifics that are already so well covered in other reviews, I chose to share with you additional material on QWP2011 instead.

As far as programming is concerned its application reminds you of the basic text only style; no fancy graphics here. I don't say that to detract the value of the program. For example the legal manual provides legal and practical answers to help you create specific documents.

I have been a fan of Quicken/Intuit products for well over a decade or more, and now have also been a fan of NOLO books; they are so beneficial at this point I have a library of them. This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities.

For the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself. Personally if you have a large family, or a complicated situation, I wouldn't hesitate to seek out professional legal counsel to avoid a lot of heartaches later to those you love.",0

"I really wish this had worked...

I had great success with using previous versions of Roxio Creator in the past - but this version 10 is the exception. It's not like I should be surprised, I read all the negative reviews here, but there were a couple of positive ones as well - so based on my previous experiences I took a chance.

The software installed fine, but even from the start I could tell that it ran slow... and it also slowed down my machine with all the stuff it was running in the background. I think I could have lived with that, as it did do a lot of what it was suppose to do. But the thing that made me uninstall it completely, was that it had the effect of making the audio of any video that was played in any player (like the regular Windows Media Player) play at a greatly reduced level. Even with all the settings cranked up to 11, you could barely hear the audio. And even worse, it had the same effect on anything that I tried to record - no matter what program you used. Systems sounds work fine, just the playback / recorded audio was affected. I tried everything to fix this audio problem - updated everything, downloaded drivers and reinstalled. Nothing worked. Uninstalled the complete Creator 10 package and now everything works fine! Just like it did before I installed the software. Well, I'll keep the software on the shelf for now - maybe some day they will get around to releasing a patch to make it work.... Just in case someone wonders, I'm running XP, not Vista.",1

"I have to say, this has to be one of the best Cad programs in a long time. From my experience with CorelCAD it appears to load much faster on my Mac compared to AutoCAD, and has a really nice GUI. Its also very easy to navigate, everything is laid out nicely. Its also always a plus when the program doesn't leave a very big footprint on your system, I believe it only took around 250MB on my HDD. That's impressive for such a versatile program! Also, the CorelCAD even  works with a few other Corel programs, such as CorelDraw. If you've been thinking about switching from AutoCAD, wait no longer! Especially with the price as cheap as it is!",0
"I find all photo editing software intimidating.  I have to admit: there are days I just miss FILM (developing it was at once concrete and creative, and actually a physical activity).  Still, film (while more organic) was very limiting compared to digital editing.  With digital photo editing the sky is the limit.  Literally.  And that's why the intimidation sets in.

This is a great start for photo editing. It does a lot.  Has a clean interface (hey, photographers are visual people, I like that the screens you work with in this software are only mildly cluttered).  You can make big changes and play with funky tools.  But it's also...beginner friendly.  It is, as said in the description, ""intuitive.""  Well laid out in terms of controls, commands, etc.  Responsive not clunky.  I DO recommend this.

And, I am ever a fan of software that's friendly to both MAC and PC.

MAC users, please note:  Check your computers, this is for Mac OS X v10.6.8 or higher.",0

"WordPerfect Office X7 Home and Student is an excellent software and contains just about everything one needs for creating great presentations on your computer or simple word processing!

Office X7 has many new tools and features. It allows you create professional quality documents with the legendary Word Perfect as well as spreadsheets. I am very amazed with what can be done with Presentations.

The software is also compatible with over sixty different file types which can really come in handy. Another awesome feature is the PDF abilities it has. Corel bills it as, ""the first PDF office suite,"" and I think they might be right. It allows for you to Import, Edit and  Export PDF files rather easily and I like this feature very much. You can even make your own fillable PDF forms!

Since I'm rather new to WordPerfect software not having used it for years I also found the built-in Help references very very useful and helpful. There are many new and extra features so people who are familiar and not so familiar with former versions of WordPerfect will have many things to discover about this really cool software.",0

"If you're anywhere between an amateur cartoonist and a professional animator or crime scene investigator, Poser 9 can make your job easier or just be a barrel of fun. It is designed to interface with your Wacom pressure-sensitive tablet. (I have one, and find this software takes morphing to a new level.) But having a Wacom is hardly a requirement; it's just that I personally like to create my own additions to the models Poser 9 offers rather than buying them.

I've always dabbled in the graphic arts and am fascinated with techniques of color and texture. Therefore, I totally love the translucency feature and the ability to spotlight an object ...and all the lighting effects. I am finding Poser 9 to be intuitive - though I haven't yet learned all its tricks - will update as I do.

Others have written long reviews repeating the specs given by the producer on the Amazon page. That's their business. I'm just gonna tell you that I like it so far, and why.",0
"I have a number of clients who have XP running on computers that will support windows 7 64bit. With no real in-place upgrade from Windows XP doing an OEM install makes good economical sense.

Why Windows 7 and not Windows 8? My client base falls into 2 groups. The differentiator is whether they have a touch screen and if they do Windows 8 is OK but with a learning curve. So many clients are opting to go with Windows 7 instead of 8.

The main thing we check on the system to be upgraded is how much memory the system can support. We upgrade the system to at least 4GB and preferably 8GB.

An excellent desktop operating systems giving new life to existing systems and helping my client's cost management is worth 5 stars to me.",0
Easy install process. It also will update your other versions. The best thing about this particular version is you get 3 uses. It's a huge advantage over the competition.

"I'm going to do a short review here and say that Corel has some advantages over Photoshop for photomanipulation or editing. Where Photoshop Elements (a fine piece of software) has you estimate or use your monitor and judgment for fixing photos, CorelDraw's Photo suite has an Integrated Image Adjustment Lab --and it tells you how you are going to affect the data on a RAW image, losing image quality by various adjustments. Instead of eyeballing what you are doing, you can retain maximum detail in highlights and shadows using their sliders and suggestions. When you exceed the limits and start to lose detail, an exclamation point crops up on the slider, showing you that you have degraded the photo quality. This is probably the best photo editing software I've used for that reason.

While I like the competing PhotoShop Elements for ease of use and the fun effect, CorelDraw has more professional features and the interface for photoediting is full of information yet easy to use. Big thumbs up.",0
"I am using this to monitor  temperature in a data center. The readings are accurate and the email alarms give just enough information without bombarding me with too much information.

The only issue I had was concerning the devices ability to send out email, and with a little help from tech support that was easily fixed. I just ordered a second device for my other data center. The quality is way better than expected, especially for the price.",0

I installed the product on a Windows 7 64 bit machine with a Blu-Ray drive.  The software worked fine with Blu-Ray movies and no problems were observed.

"While I can review a computer game after ""beating it"" - often a week or two after purchase - with Norton 360 I waited several months after installing it to come to any judgement. There is always a learning curve with any serious software product where you tweak the settings, learn what combination works well for you, and so on. I really feel a serious package like this should be tested out for many weeks - not days - before a decision is made about it.

I run Norton 360 on my main home PC, from which I run several websites. This means I am running database development software, graphic editing software, video editing software, logging software and much more on this machine. Plus I'm a game reviewer, so I'm running some pretty intensive games on it as well. My machine does a great variety of things. You would think if an issue was going to trigger, that I'd probably trigger it.

I definitely agree that you need to spend a little time setting up the software to work well with your surfing and net patterns. Someone who does a lot of networking operations might need ports more open than someone who just reads email and wants their computer locked up tightly. Now, that being said, the interface is rather straightforward to do this. Once you set it up, you're all set.

I haven't run into any issues with Norton 360 once it was set up well. Yes I had to do some tweaking to get my various POP mail accounts working - many of which are customized and using non-standard ports. It was a one time operation, and has been set since then.

In terms of the quality of the anti-virus software, I always give Norton very high marks. Our cable company provided free anti-virus software as part of our cable bill. Virusses got right through their ""shield"". When I put on Norton, Norton instantly spotted those virusses and eliminated them without any fuss.

I completely agree that some systems out there might have issues with this software package, just like some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. Where an XBox 360 is a perfect clone of every other XBox 360 out there, every PC is unique. Every person has different internet settings, different mail software, and perhaps most importantly, different virusses and spyware that have snuck on your system. Undoubtedly there is always going to be some unique blend of these things that causes a system to crash - with OR without Norton 360. In general, though, I really feel Norton 360 should work extremely well on most systems.

Well recommended - but as always, back up your system before beginning, and have your network documentation handy so you know which specific ports you happen to be personally using, to keep those open.",0
"This edition of Windows XP is primarily business oriented, but there are certain features that would be useful in the Home Edition of Windows XP. Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is ""awesome"", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The ""start menu"", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the ""start menu"" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, ""ME"" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. ""KODAK"". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home. It all depends on the user and the environment, as simple as that.",0

"Installed the Lantronix USB device server in 10 minutes, just connected to ethernet, installed software, and plugged in devices. I am using it with an epson scanner and an HP Officejet K60- which is supposed to be (acording to hp) non-compatible with a wireless network. I bought this with the expectation it probably wouldn't work with the HP but it did! wireless connection is great- entire network has full control over devices on other side of house, 2 ports left for any other devices I wish to network, couldn't be happier this product was worth the price for me.

Update: When DSL signal is low or reset, device server sometimes needs to be reconnected or reset as well - usually this is just a matter of disconnecting power and usb devices then reconnecting but sometimes pressing the pinhole reset button is required. It can be annoying but it's mostly attributed to my poor dsl signal, other than that still works great, still highly recommend!",0
"Snow Leopard may look the same as Leopard on the surface, but the more you use it, the more you realize just how comprehensive and powerful an update it is!  From the initial installation, you will notice that your Mac is snappier - and if you look at the space on your hard drive, you'll see that installing Snow Leopard has freed up more than a few gigabytes of space.  As you go about your normal workflow, you'll start to stumble onto things that are just - well - better.  I'll give you one example.  I decided that I wanted to relocate my iTunes Library, but that I didn't want it to take an entire drive.  I have several 1TB externals, and one looked tempting.  But it was formatted with a single partition.  I did a brief search in the Mac help section and was delighted to find that I am no longer stuck with static partitioning on formatted drives. In the past, if I wanted to resize a partition, it was a complicated process, first backing up all data on the drive, then using disk utility to reformat and then partition the drive, and finally copying my data to the new partitions.  With Leopard, all that is consolidated into one step.  In disk utility, I can select the ""partition"" option, drag the size of my existing partition to release space on the drive (or type in a number to specify exactly how big I want the partition to be!)  Then create a new partition or partitions in the empty space - No loss of data, no reformatting, dead simple.  This is a powerful feature, which used to require third party software to accomplish.  And Snow Leopard is full of such ""Aha!"" moments.  A great update to an already great OS.",0

"Ive been a fan of Corel products for a number of years because (1) they are less expensive and (2) they give me more functionality and are just as effective as Photoshop and Office.  Now I have the ultimate graphics package.

Ive spent a good bit of time investigating my new graphics package by watching the video tutorials and using the photo editing software.  I love it!  Ive found that a number of functions I often use have been simplified.  For example, I used to spend time working the photo transform to align the photo just the way I wanted it, but now its much easier.  Simply use the transform function that has alignment marks all the way across the picture.  Use the arrows to move the alignment marks, and its done in a flash.  Easy, effective.

I also appreciate the customizable interface.  I have a number of functions I often use while editing photos.  I can select those I frequently use without having all the remaining functions I do not use cluttering up my workspace.  When I want to change them, I can easily do to.

Theres much to explore in this graphics suite that I have not yet investigated such as the drawing software, but I will use in the near future.

Again, I love this software and am happy to recommend it and other Corel products to those who need easy functionality at a very reasonable price.

FIVE STARS!",0
"Others have covered most of what I want to say, but I thought I'd add a few comments.

First, VMware really rocks on my 8-core Mac Pro. For some reason I don't quite understand, it runs some Windows benchmarks within a virtual machine *faster* than booting Windows natively on the box! Graphics-intensive apps seem to do better natively, but anything that does lots of I/O seems to run faster under VMware.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that it's really more than just Windows on a Mac - you can run just about any Intel operating system within VMware. On my Mac Pro, I have Linux (both RedHat and SuSE/Novell) and a few other old Intel-based operating systems - even a very old OS/2. Honestly, this helped me justify the price of my Mac Pro - one box runs Mac, several versions of Windows, Linux and so on. And they all run really well... :)

Great job, VMware!",0
"I can hardly believe broadband has not covered the US yet and so many still have to suffer with dialup. In the meantime, this is the way to go with laptop or notebooks. Get a power and phoneline surge protecter too. Mine blu-up and I had to replace it.",0
"Visually, for folks who mainly use the Mac for entertainment, this is a minor upgrade--frankly not worth the bother. But for folks who use OSX for its power, speed and reliability this is a very significant step forward. Most importantly, perhaps, is spreading the workload among cores in multi-core hardware and rewriting old workhorses like Finder for 64-bit code (although it still looks much like the Finder of yore). Snopard, at last, is meeting the computing potential of current hardware, and seems CPU-ready for the oft-promised but slow-in-coming powerful software  that could take advantage of multicore hardware. For demanding users, this upgrade is well-placed and well-timed at an amazingly low price point.

Curiously, although BootCamp (for Windows cohabitation) has been upgraded as well - it mentions Vista compatibility - not a word on the forthcoming Windows-7 release - I'd wait till the dust settles on that issue with future updates. The upgrade went smooth as can be (except for a Canon printer needing new driver) and most applications like Apple iWork and the Adobe imaging line just kept on going; applications like Bento are explicitly Snopard-aware

A fabulous upgrade for serious Mac users, scientists, photographers and business people ... but a non-event for media-craving entertainment use.",0

"I am a serious user of desktop computers and have been for a long time. I own a small graphics company, small publishing company and I write for a living. I upgraded recently to a 64-bit 8-core unit that I built with the help of a software tech engineer. I've never purchased a ""brand name"" computer except years ago when CPM was the hot language of desktops. When DOS came along I started building my own. Each new upgrade is always a challenge since software makers are using more and more space to write less efficient software. That is, they dump the parts of software that are really useful and replace them with ""cute"" stuff that takes one, two, three or more mouse clicks to get to or uncover or work with than it did before -- and it always takes up much more space. Win 7 is an example of an upgrade that I refer to as a downgrade. I have been using XP Pro Professional 32 bit for a long time. I tried to install XP Pro 64 bit but it was totally chaotic, so I had to move into Win 7. I purchased my copy at Amazon. Frankly, I'd prefer to return it as ""broken,"" since I think it's a piece of junk. Apparently those who design today's working software (OS and other software) don't actually use it to make a living. In other words, they aren't self-employed and they don't find themselves relying upon a software to be efficient (time is money made or lost, depending on the amount of time a project takes). Certainly, those who designed everything after XP aren't using what they design to make a living . . .they just design stuff that looks cutesy. Take the icons in Win7. No more lists without large icons next to them and we can't make them smaller. No more Windows Explorer, either. Oh, they say they have it, but they don't. What  they have in place of WinExp is a piece of junk that probably works on an iPhone but not at all well on a desktop. I have this brand new high speed, 32 gigabyte RAM computer and it's SLOWER than the one I'm writing this review on. Yes, I have reverted to my 4 gigabyte RAM, 2-core, XP Pro computer when writing or cruising the Net or doing low space requirement work with graphics. On top of Win 7 being inefficient, Adobe has decided to change their software as well. I'm using CS6 on the Cloud with Win 7 and it's taking longer to get things done than with my older CS2 in XP. An example: Adobe dumped their extract from Photoshop and replaced with something that's, Yup, ""cute."" It doesn't extract well at all, though, so I have to keep this CS2 in this computer and do all that work here (Win 7 doesn't like CS2). Win 7 64 bit also demands a high price for replacing all software from the 32 bit, so even though they tell you that you can use the compatibility mode, it's a lie. Yes, you can install into it, but it runs at the same speed as your older computer whether it's 2-core or 4 or 8 core. Compatibility simply means yes, you can install here and using the (86) mode you can run it.

Bottom line is, there's way too much to list here that doesn't prove efficient once Win 7 is installed. I should have written every single major bump in the road down, but I didn't. I just packed up the computer and placed it into my wife's office and said, ""You now have the world's fastest email computer."" So, we have four computers here. Hers with Win 7 and all the rest with XP. Too many programs would not install and we lost the use of three peripherals including one printer, and two scanners.

So, we'll keep on working with old nuts and bolts on three computers and hope that someday, somebody will design fast, efficient, non touch screen OS software that really works and works with all our software. Microsoft has always been empirical about what they deliver to us, this Win 7 is an insult and of course, Win 8 is not even a suggestion for PCs.",1

"Virus protection is important to me.  I have used a variety of virus protection programs throughout the years.  I haven't noticed a huge difference between any of the virus protection software I have used.  I have used Norton products before and Norton Security meets the standards of past iterations.

Norton Security offers lots of different options, all of which can be turned on or off so that it fits the user's needs.  It offers virus protection, identity protection, and the ability to optimize a computer.  Running scans is easy and the software runs quietly in the background.  I haven't noticed a decrease in performance on my computers.

Navigating the software is easy and it's just a few clicks to any of the functions.  Using the functions is easy and everything seems to run fluidly.

Overall, this software has been working well for me.  I haven't had any issues.  Internet security software isn't all that interesting, but it's a necessary item for me and I am satisfied with Norton Security.",0
"Part of a trio of video editing software versions, this is the best. This new version has a couple of notable new features including a new multi camera editor, and New i7 (intel) support. Each version allows for more cameras with ultimate allowing up to 6. Other important pieces of the software include over 1500 titles, effects, and video templates  best of all, you can share that video on a few different web video services like YouTube, and facebook.

If you are not wedded to a particular eco system, then this is a very good place to go. The adobe video products are good, but I believe that this is a better and easier to use system.

The harder choice may be deciding if you want the standard, plus or ultimate. For most folks the standard will likely be fine and for those wanting more camera angles with synced audio, then the higher version will be your choice.",0

"I like the idea of the software, but due to the age of my computer, initially, I was not been able to utilize the full potential of the system.  I had to upgrade our software to meet specifications...even then, the computer runs rather slow.  The software is very robust.

The software itself was easy to install.  Using the software can be a little intimidating for the novice user.  This software is geared toward a CAD operator, not a firm (such as engineering) that would not use this software on a daily basis.  An ""AutoCAD LT for Dummies"" would be a good compliment to this software.  With patience, one can figure out how to operate the software for a project.

For a CAD operator who utilizes this type of program on a daily basis, the software would be excellent.  The software seems to have all the tools one would need to create the most detailed drawing.

"I use this every year.  While I am not 100% satisfied with every aspect of Turbo Tax Home and Business, it does save me a lot of money as opposed to bringing it to a tax man.  I have used TT for about that last nine years.  It is easy and only occasionally to I have any confusion.  This usually explains things very well.  I've tried other less expensive similar products and they were not as detailed and left me with many questions when going through the process.",0
"I had used Pinnacle Studio 17 plus. I found it a little clunky, but it was usable. I was sad I got plus because I didn't realize there was a higher ultimate version and there was no way to upgrade. So this time I'm glad to be getting ultimate.

Things that are new for 19:
-Project Bins--a bin that you can throw a bunch of video/sound that you want to use, or a way to put video/sound into a organized bins without having to move the videos from the folders they really are located in. The bins contain video links, not the actual videos. This is great for me. I like having my videos organized by time and events. Also I have tons of videos and pictures in one folder. This allows me to grab the best and bin them without creating duplicate video folders and taking up more space. It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it)
-Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them.
-Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically!
-Support for more file types and better 4k support.

When you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.

But I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.

My understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...

But for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for ""Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial"". That will give you an idea of how the program works. I think Premier Elements is a little bit easier for a beginner, but I think it's easier to do some more complicated things with Pinnacle Studio.",0
"Until recently I hadn't used Norton internet security software in many years. I decided to stop using it because it was simply more trouble than it was worth. It was basically nothing more than an obtrusive, bloated, system-slowing annoyance. And to be honest, I only gave Norton another shot and began using it again because I was able to acquire it for free.

Well, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this latest version because it is nothing like the last version of Norton internet security software I tried. It now has a nice list protections and features, and this version also comes with a money back guarantee.

Since installing this latest version I've noticed no increase in boot time, I've noticed no slowing of my system, and it basically just runs in the background with very little required interaction. Norton claims this version will actively protect you against viruses and other online security threats, and so far it's given me no reason to believe it's not doing that. And that's exactly what I want/expect from an internet security program. I want it to do its job, do it well, and leave me alone as much as possible.

I've had this latest version installed for about a month now, and so far I'm pretty impressed and quite happy with it. Do give this latest version a try. I'm fairly certain you'll be happy with it too.

If you have any questions about this software, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.",0
"Chances are in your house you have several computers, maybe a laptop or two and a desktop in the den or the your kids room.  All these machines serve different functions -- one is for your business, one might be for storing digital pictures and the kids may use theirs for playing games.  They are all different and even though they reside under the same roof it is next to impossible to share files with them all and when it comes to backup -- well, just ask yourself this, when is the last time you backed any of them up?  You are a digital home but a connected home you are not.

Enter Microsoft's newest product, Windows Home Server.  A revolutionary product that offers consumers centralized storage and backups in their households with a product that you plug in and literally let it run without any intervention on your part.

Windows Home Server makes the concept of a connected home a reality in a simple, easy to use package that will bring your entire digital family together in one place.  Imagine never having to worry about backups again because they are taken automatically, every night, while you sleep.  Think of how easy it would be to share digital pictures, movies and files with your family without having to e-mail them or put them on USB fobs that always seem to get lost.  What if you could check to make sure your kids have their anti-virus protection running without having to check their computer manually?  How about never having to worry about your precious family photos, home videos and important documents getting lost because of a computer crash thanks to data redundancy?

If these sound like your idea of a dream, then dream no more.  All these features and more await you in Windows Home Server.

The idea is simple.  Put a machine (doesn't have to be too powerful) in an out of the way location in the house.  It doesn't need a keyboard or a mouse, just hard drives.  But wait, even the hard drives don't have to be all the same or fit inside the box.  You can hook up any combination of hard disks you want -- from internal to external USB and firewire drives.  Windows Home Server manages them for you, creating one big pool of disk space that is duplicated across the drives -- so if one fails, you don't lose one byte of data!

Backups are a breeze as well; every night Windows Home Server backups up files from all the connected PC's and stores them on the server.  However, it doesn't just back up files -- it intelligently decides which files are different, and which aren't and doesn't backup duplicates.  So if everyone in your house has Microsoft Word installed, it won't create 5 backup copies of it.  Just one copy which all 5 computers can restore from!

Traveling and need access to your Powerpoint presentation or important document?  Fire up a web browser and securely access any file stored on the server!  Better yet, remote connect to any computer in your household running Windows Vista or XP and use it as if you were sitting right in front of it.  All from a secure web browser!

One more thing for all you XBOX 360 owners out there, or those of you who have digital picture frames that are network-aware -- Windows Home Server has the ability to stream content to your XBOX 360 and to your digital picture frames!  Functionality ""out of the box"", which will no doubt be extended further as third party applications start to appear thanks to the Windows Home Server Software Development Kit (SDK) that Microsoft has released for WHS.

In Windows Home Server Microsoft has created a product (based off of Windows 2003 Server) that any household can use and enjoy without having to worrying about ""IT Support"".  The product just simply works, and needs almost zero maintenance.  Watch for vendors such as HP to come out with pre-configured ""appliances"" this fall such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-EX475-MediaSmart-Home-Server-AMD-Live-64-Bit-Sempron-Processor-1-TB-Hard-Drive/dp/B000UXZUZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP EX475 MediaSmart Home Server (AMD Live/ 64 Bit Sempron Processor, 1 TB Hard Drive)</a>&nbsp;or use spare hardware you already have in your house to ""roll your own"" by purchasing this OEM software kit.  Either way, your home will change forever and become not just a digital home, but a connected home where everyone can share data and have a safe, enjoyable experience using their machines.",0
"I switched to MAC when the Intel processors became available.  I was a Windows fan before that and didn't realize what I was missing. Now that I have Leopard life is sweet.  Everything works and works well. That is something I could never say about Windows. Guess what folks, I got the full blown version for way less than the basic version of Vista!  Enough said.",0
Good purchase,0
"I can hardly believe broadband has not covered the US yet and so many still have to suffer with dialup. In the meantime, this is the way to go with laptop or notebooks. Get a power and phoneline surge protecter too. Mine blu-up and I had to replace it.",0
"This is an excellent alternative for those people out there that do not know how to use FTP commands.  :) A subscription is required for the person sending the file - which can be up to 2GB in size.  The sender uploads the file through their simple interface, and then a link is sent to the recipient - who can securely download the attachments.  The site is protected by 256 bit encryption, and they use their own compression algorithm.  I have been using this to send sound MP3 files to a podcast to which I contribute.  Bear in mind, you will have to renew this subscription each year.",0
Nice product. Easy installation. Works well for me personally. Windows has done it again.,0
"Been using H&R Block tax software (Tax Cut) for more years than I can remember.
Used Turbo Tax before that for several years. Finally tried Tax Cut, now H&R Block because my Dad was using it and  the lower cost than Turbo Tax.
It has handled everything for me over the years from K 1 forms to investment forms including cap gains/losses etc.
It has even handled for me with out a hitch a necessitated amended return.
As my forms have gotten more complex over the years I have never had an issue.

Now that being said I have one recommendation:
Even though at this point in time I am very familiar with how this tax program flows I do carefully read each step in the interview and answer each question carefully. This little detail will insure you get the forms and pages you need. If you do miss something you will not get the page you need. You will have to go back and hunt it down. You are better off saying yes to a question you are not sure of. You can always skip the part when you get to it.
This year I may actually use the download function for some financial firms like Fidelity to save me manually keying in all the data. Much easier to verify and be done with it.
Actually this program makes it a joy to do your taxes, if I can say that.
The State part is just as easy because of the carry over from the Federal part.
Push of a button and its e-filed. Love it.",0
This is a very nice piece of photo editing software. It is intuitive enough so that people who do not have a lot of in depth experience with photo editing can pick it up easily and start editing. It is also robust enough so that experienced editors have the tools they need to work their magic without paying the high end photo editing software prices. I highly recommend it.,0
"It was amazingly easy to set up for a person like me who knows nearly nothing about computer networks. I was expecting a painful experience and a need to call customer support, but after responding to some simple questions from the ""Setup assistant"" on my Mac, I was suddenly told that it was all done! It works flawlessly ever since, never needing any attention. Just exactly what technology should be like. Thank you Apple!",0
"very good computer the intel Dual Core i3-2120 3.3GHz CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD configuration is good enough for light use. The price is amazing",0
Works great,0
Excellent incremental upgrade from X6. Noticeable performance improvements. Much more responsive.,0
"Sure, there are other video editing software options out there, but quite frankly, I'm not going to spend close to a grand for something that I consider just a hobby and do for fun. i have been using VS since the X3 edition. Each upgrade (now up to x6) has added more features and streamlined the interface to make it so even novice users can make some great content.

If you are looking for editing software at a decent price, really consider this one.

I'll save the tech aspects for others, as they know way more about it than me. All I know is, it runs smooth, and is easy to use. The help feature to learn different things is also very well done. It's scary to think I have barely even touched the surface of what this software can do.",0
"I was looking for a basic image editor: nothing fancy, just something that would redo and touch up pictures.

Wow! Pixelator was everything I could've wished for, and way more. It's easy to learn the basics on it, but you can also ""get fancy"" if your needs or desire are so inclined. It's an excellent tool for a newbie, but it also has room to satisfy someone with a bit more expertise.

I'd highly recommend it for a non-expert like me who wants something that works without needing an advanced degree. But photo mavens won't be disappointed, either.

For the price, an excellent value.",0
"This is a great USB hub, it works perfectly! I love the blue illumination, so you can see that it's working with a quick glance.",0
I like it !! It has nice features like web administration and it works pretty well. Great Product for an awesome price.,0
"I've used TurboTax for over 20 years, have never been audited and wouldn't use any other tax software.  If you're wondering what to do, just buy it and you won't be sorry.  It's accurate and simple to use.",0
"Yes it does install on a Windows 7 64bit machine, because I installed it on mine.  There are of course issues, since it should have been made to install on 32 or 64 bits just as easily as one or the other.  And I'm assuming it's just 64bit that has the issue and not Windows 7 vs Vista or XP (yes xp! lol).

I believe, if memory serves me right, install normally with admin rights maybe, and then you have to adjust the program executable, ie., right click run in compatibility mode or admin rights, etc etc.

Great tool that works great by itself or even better with a gps device.  Doesn't just give directions, but you can also input various data options, such as gas, mileage of the vehicle, stops, etc.

Looking forward to the next version and hopefully will install without user interference for Windows 8 32 and 64 bits.",0
"It starts by interview and then step by step instruction with help topics along the way. it has a calculator included and IRS forms of many kind more than what I needed. The state filing was also easy though E filing cost little extra with no clear advantage for Illinois as it is simple for me.
It doe import data from lost year and files in the stuff where it is needed even at the end where you use it as a pin to file the E File. E file for federal is free. It has even a gift card section where you can get part of it to spend a t best buy. You can spend it at Amazon.",0
"Pretty good software for my purposes, and at a good price, been using H&R Block for a few years and I can't find anything to complain about.",0
"I have used several paint programs including the Corel Painter X3 which is intended for more serious and professional applications. The Corel Painter Essentials 5 provides a set of nice features for general photos touch-up and artwork painting. I like its simple user friendly interface which requires very little learning to use. The program also works nicely with my Wacom tablet.

On top of its standard painting tools, the program also has an auto-paint feature which automatically enhance our photos with various styles and effects. I found this feature pretty fun to use for adding artistic effects to the photos.

If you are looking for a good painting software for general photos touch-up and effects, these would be a good one to consider.",0
"Installing and running McAfee on a Windows 7 laptop was easy and non-intrusive. It asked me to set up an ID so I could download and use it on 3 different systems, I did that for ease. It did ask for auto renewal that I declined and then it started installing. I had to uninstall a previous virus protection software that had expired before installing McAfee. It was not intrusive like setting up Norton on my other laptop.

McAfee takes care of virus protection and online security, it does make some sites load slower. Other than that it does not interfere with the workings and does not slow down the system. It also updated definitions in the background and did not make it a fussy process like Norton which kept saying ""Your system is unprotected"" and made me do several tasks manually before it was up and running.

The only negative criticism I have is that it deleted all my cookies without asking and also all my passwords that were stored in Chrome. That made life difficult, if I had known it would do that I would have first changed those passwords.",0
Easy to file your taxes correctly.,0
"I have sort of evolved into the computer techie for my extended family and therefore am responsible for the digital health of about a dozen computers and a couple dozen people. That is quite a responsibility. Since many computers come equipped with McAfee and various other antivirus programs. Some did not heed my advice and they went and downloaded the freeware antivirus utilities. This may be coincidence, but without fail every single one of those individuals (about 5 or 6 computers in all) ended up being knocked out of commission by viruses. On the computers that have had Norton on them, since 1999, I have not had one instance of a virus.
I know that this experience isn't everybody's, and I know that no program can stop all viruses all the time, but so far Norton has a perfect record for me, so I will keep using it. Now that they have developed the Bloodhound feature to protect against new and unknown viruses, I'm assuming that it will be even better.
My one warning is that right out of the box, Live Update is not activated. I don't know why this is as many of my family who have installed it themselves do not manually activate it (since they didn't know they had to) and therefore operate with really old virus definitions until I go into the settings and turn LiveUpdate on.
I have not hesitate to recommended Norton for every computer that my extended family has purchased. The never-ending rebates which often reduce the price of the software to almost nothing are great too. My recommendation is obvious: Norton is the best out there.",0
"I just finished playing ""Secret of the Old Clock"", and I loved it!  Before I say anything more, I think it important to add that I am 35 years old - so, take it from me, these games are great fun for ANYONE over the age of about 10!

This particular game is set in the 1930's (the depression era), and is about a young girl whose mother recently passed away - leaving her a bed & breakfast/bakery to run.  She did, however, write her friend before passing, asking her to come & help her 17 year old daughter if something should happen to her - and her friend rushed right over, trying to help out, but knowing nothing of the business.

Strange things started happening at the inn at about this time, and both the young girl & her guardian are convinced that she is having a nervous breakdown - that it's all in her head.  Especially since not only is she grieving the loss of her mother, but they are running out of money.  An elderly neighbor (who was quite rich) had promised to leave them plenty of money in his will - but when he died, it looked as though he left all of his money & estate to a man who supposedly taught mind reading & esp.

In comes Nancy Drew...  Is the will originally found the ONLY one?  Could it be a forgery?  And what of all the strange noises & happenings at the inn?  Who's behind them, or are they really all in the teenager's mind?  These are the questions you'll have to answer while playing ""teen detective"".

I found several differences between this game & the other Nancy Drew games I've played to date.  First, the graphics are better - in fact they are just as good as some of the more high-tech games I've played.  Second, you actually get to drive a car (but be sure to watch out for potholes)!  Last, there was much more ground to cover - which I really liked - so you get to see a lot of the town, and speak with several people (rather than just being confined to a house, and only talking to 1 or 2 others).  Oh, there's one more difference...  You actually have to earn money in this game - to pay for gas, car repairs, games & other necessary items.

Overall, I think this game is a ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys (or had enjoyed) the Nancy Drew series.  One of the great assets of these games is that they allow you to choose a difficulty level - but, I must warn all you other adults out there, if you haven't played many ND games (or even if you have!), you may want to choose the ""junior"" level.  This will allow you to get more hints if you need them - and if you don't, you just don't ask for them - as it's the number of hints that will change based on the level you choose to play at.

Another 2 thumbs up for the creators of Nancy Drew!!!",0
"I am using this antenna with a pair of Linksys WAP54G wireless APs, one acting as a repeater.  The main unit has a 1 watt amplifier hooked to this antenna, the repeater had nothing.

I added a 1 watt amplifier to it with the standard antenna and it has been working for the past 6 months in that configuration.

"Although I had no major issues with Vista, it's performance left a lot to be desired. After upgrading to Windows 7, my system runs like a new system. I thought about doing a ""clean install"", but decided to let ""7"" attempt to upgrade Vista since I have so many programs that would have needed re-installation. The upgrade went off perfectly. The total time from start to finish was 2 and 1/2 hours, on a dual core notebook system with 4GB of RAM. After installation, ""Windows Update"" found 9 new updates and installed them. All my programs still work, and retained their settings. My wireless network also retained its setting. My system boots much faster, and shuts down almost instantly now. The almost constant disk activity I saw with Vista is gone. My battery life has also improved by about 15%. If you're unhappy with Vista, I highly recommend Windows 7. If you're happy with Vista, then you make want to think twice about upgrading. Much of the code under the hood of Windows 7 hasn't changed. It's just been tweaked and optimized to run much better. Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too. If you do plan to upgrade, make note that the upgrade only upgrades similar versions of Vista. For example, 32bit Vista Home Premium will only upgrade to 32bit Windows 7 Home Premium, etc.",0
"I found Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 relatively easy to learn and use, and I had no issues with installation either. My last version of this software was version X3, and I certainly did find this version to be quite a bit faster, and the user interface to be quite a bit better. This latest version boasts several performance improvements over previous versions, and it also has an even longer list of editing tools. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is an efficient and comprehensive video editing program that has more than enough features and video editing capabilities for the average user.

One reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. But the main reason I got this new version is for the 64-bit high-end Special FX Pack, the really great slideshow maker, and the much faster video rendering. This software is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the muscle department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

Something else I wanted to mention is that I own several other video editing programs, and while their specs are the same as Corel's, for some reason Corel's rendered output just plain looks better. I don't know why, but it does. And not just a little bit better either. It's significantly better. After you finish your project, what you see onscreen is significantly clearer and smoother. This, of course, isn't a minor thing, this is a major thing, and this tells me that Corel's software is definitely doing something differently, something much better than what their competitor's software is doing. So, while there are other video editing programs that certainly have more bells and whistles than Corel's, if the quality of the finished product is the most important thing to you, do take Corel's top quality output into account.

Now, like I said, my last version of the software was version X3, and while all the improvements to this latest version are really terrific, what makes this newest version a real winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly. I hope you found this review helpful.",0
"We have a 5 year old laptop that we were about to throw away because it was too slow running XP.  So I thought let's install Windows 7 and see what happens.  The difference in speed dramatic.  Now the programs launch right away and there is little delay switching back and forth between tasks.  It feels like a new computer.  Later on I placed a $[...] 4GB flash drive in the USB port to take advantage of ReadyBoost.  Now this laptop is really speedy.  Since we were going to trash this laptop, but now we can use it a couple more years, the purchase of the Windows 7 upgrade was well worth the price.

Update 11/3/09: Someone commented that maybe it was just faster because I cleaned out the ""bloatware"" that was on the old XP system.  Well that doesn't apply in this case, because I'm talking about a clean XP install vs. a clean Windows 7 install.  Previously we tried to make the laptop faster by installing XP from scratch.  That didn't help, but Windows 7 did the trick to speed things up.  I can only guess that Windows 7 is just better optimized under the hood.",0

Seems to be much improved over the earlier pre-VM4 versions.  Pricing is also very good, but you'll have to go out and buy a copy of Windows 7 which isn't cheap.  Microsoft sells their OS for much higher pricing than Apple.  However, if you have an old copy of the Windows XP install CD around, you can use that to install Win XP and then use a much cheaper license for Microsoft's Windows 7 ""Upgrade"" CD to bring it up to the latest Microsoft OS.",0
"First off, there appear to be several reviews talking about how this program is slow, and is a pain if you were using previous versions.  I can't speak to the latter there, this was my first ever copy or iteration of this software. It worked fine for me!  Granted, I don't have hundreds of people in here, and oodles of data and multimedia to content with.  Perhaps it bloats out if you have an enormous tree, but it was't the case for me.

I like the way it's laid out, and being a newcomer to the overall genre, I don't have a ton of experience with other pieces of software to compare it to.  To that, I won't have a ton to write about in this review.  I'm a genealogy newbie, and I got the software, installed it, ran updates, and started to use it.  No problems in any regard.  I enjoyed it, and if you're just starting out, you probably will, too.",0

"I recently upgraded to Windows XP from Windows 98 Second Edition, and I have been THOROUGHLY impressed!  With Windows 98 I experienced frequent blue screens and crashes.  With Windows XP all of those problems are now history.  Also, many of the drivers I needed to load AFTER loading Windows 98 are now already included.  My video card drivers were loaded, my CD burner functions were all present, and my scanner worked flawlessly without installing any additional software.
The biggest hurdle with this product is successful installation.  If you have older components you may have significant problems getting them to function with the new OS.  Some older apps are also likely to have difficulty.  My hardware and my software are all fairly current, so I had no trouble.
I have upgraded my newer computer at home with Windows XP, but the older computer at my church study has Windows 98, and will have it for some time.  I am reluctant to upgrade because of the installation problems inevitable with the older components.
This product is definitely worth the price, but some persons may need to upgrade components BEFORE upgrading their OS.
If you have a newer or brand new computer and are seeking the smoothest, steadiest and most solid OS, I HIGHLY recommend Windows XP.",0
"You cannot go wrong using the TurboTax Deluxe Fed Efile and State 2013 tax program. I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I have found that it is an excellent tax preparation program. The program takes you step by step in preparing your taxes and although it may not be painless, it is easy to follow the directions. I was really pleased with the Amazon special offer price.",0

"What's not to love about a plug-n-play little hockey puck which solves so many of my connectivity problems.  My Mac G4 MDD is notorious for having too few USB and Firewire connections, and a power supply which is a bit week for daisy chained devices.  This powered hub solved my problems and it was a simple as, open the box, hook it up, turn it on, and start using it.",0

"I was tired of trying different products that did different things and often competed with each other when I asked my sis-in-law what products she recommended to protect her computers, manage backups and secure her identity. She has worked with computers for decades and proudly holds the title of Family Geek to this day. She gifted me with my first license for Norton 360 about 2008 and I have resubscribed ever since.

The most important stuff that Norton 360 does is rarely noticeable. Every once in awhile, while surfing, I will get a heads up about a website known for malicious activity or told that a file I tried to download is corrupt. N360 runs regular scans to check for viruses and infections or to let me know when it is time to take some additional action to tune up for performance. My favorite and most used feature is the Identity Safe, which does exactly what Norton says: ""remembers, secures, and automatically enters your usernames and passwords for you, so they can't be lost or stolen.""

One trick that I learned (that at least one other person here has shared) is do not set up your account to automatically renew. I have a Google alert set up to let me know when Amazon and other retailers have it on sale. I have easily saved as much as 75% compared to what Norton would have charged me to auto-renew. You can even buy a couple at a time because the key codes stack.

After years of concerns about our home PCs getting hacked, infected or whatever, it has been great to really not think of it much at all.",0
"PC Mag [...] had rated this very highly which is how I learned of it.  The full article is available at [...].  It is a very good, inexpensive, dependable backup software application.  It has good flexibility and is user friendly (for a backup program).  It allows you to back up an entire hard drive or just selected folders and files.  You can do full or incremental backups and you can schedule them or initiate them manually.  I have mine scheduled for a full backup once a week and a daily incremental backup, all to a removable USB hard drive.  You can tell it to break the back up into 2 GByte slices so you can keep the backup hard drive nicely decluttered by running Windows defrag program from time to time.  We have a Windows XP operating system and it works very well with that.  The program also allows you to create a disaster recovery CD and a corresponding disaster recovery backup on a hard drive.  You can set levels for compression and encryption and set password protection or not.  The more the compression and encryption, the longer the backup takes but the smaller and more secure it is (the default values are fine for me).  You can also adjust the intensity of the backup effort so it will run more slowly in the background so it won't interfere with you while you are using the computer or more quickly if you schedule the backups to be done at night (as I do).  The manufacturer was very responsive when I had some initial questions about it.  Unlike Norton Ghost, which we also have, it will not communicate on-line when you tell it not to.

To add to my initial review one year later (January 2010): in a year of ownership I have greatly benefited by learning to depend on the program's termination features. You can have it just run the backup on schedule and stop, or after the backup you can also set it to automatically perform ""power"" functions. These include shutdown, log off, Standby, and Hibernate (assuming you have configured your computer for Hibernate). What this means is that my copy of this program at work starts a backup a little after my normal office hours and shuts the computer down afterwards. So I get an incremental backup of the day's complete work without spending productive office time doing it and save energy by turning it off, too. At home I have it tuck itself into Standby after our normal bed time. So we get full use of the computer all day, a backup of the day's activities afterwards, and don't let it run up our utility bill, either. And Standby turns off the USB backup drive as well to preserve its longevity.  On the other end of the spectrum you can set it to wake up your computer from Standby to run a backup before you need to use the computer.  The settings also show up in the Scheduled Tasks for Windows XP and Windows Vista (unlike any of the Ghost products). We now have four licensed copies of Genie. It is easily a better backup tool than the others we have tried: Norton Ghost 10.0, Norton Ghost 14.0, Norton 360, DT Utilities' PC Backup Pro, or the native Windows XP and Windows Vista backup programs. Genie does what you tell it to, unlike Norton Ghost which has a fit because it missed one day's scheduled incremental backup or Windows Vista's native backup which will only restore the computer to the way it was when the backup was made and therefore requires the same size hard drives partitioned into volumes exactly the same way (sort of a joke because by the time a good hard drive wears out you find they do not make them that small anymore so you can not replace it with an identical hard drive!).",0
"Love it.  Love the Word program, very user friendly.  Easy for writing and editing my manuscripts in.

"I knew I needed to plan and have a will but kept putting it off.  This product got me started and greatly reduced legal fees.  I knew I wanted a living trust and wanted a lawyer involved but dreaded the expense.  By using this product to become informed about all the questions and forms, I was able to prepare my will and a framework for the trust which I can now take to a lawyer for verification and filing for a fraction of the cost of going in cold. The product produces the appropriate documents which you can have notarized and will serve the legal need, but for something this important I wanted to spare my kids any issues by having everything reviewed and officially verified.

We used a Living Trust for my mother which worked really well for her and then for us following her death which kept the disposition of her effects, sale of her house, etc., as painless as possible in a state where the estate laws are onerous. It encouraged me to do the same for my kids.

I'd been avoiding the process until I bought this product which got me started.  In the box is the software CD and a book, but it is not an instruction manual.  It is 'The Legal Answer Book for Families' and includes the topics: adoption, child custody, domestic partnerships, teenagers, elder care, marriage, name change, tax breaks and divorce with free updates on the Nolo website.  The product user manual is a pdf file included in the software so an internet connection is not required to access it.

The product installed easily on my Win7 PC and offered a free download of updates but upon reading the items included in the update, I didn't bother as they didn't apply to me.  The software starts with a short movie which I found useful and informative.  It is laid out well and very easy to use. There are five sections which can be tackled separately.  They are: Will, Health Care Directive, Durable Power of Attorney for Finances, Final Arrangements and Information for Caregivers and Survivors.  The documents created are listed under each topic as you create them and you can easily return to any one to review or change it.

There is plenty of help along the way, including a checklist of items to gather before starting each section.  This is precisely why I wanted to use such a product before involving a lawyer.  Having all this thought out in advance and recorded is well worth the cost of the software.

From what I've seen so far, the product is very complete and covers needs for people in all categories.  I think it's important to have a will and this product is meeting my needs really well.",0

"Please be aware that the vast majority of the reviews for this product are false and probably written by employees of the competing product. Ok enough of that, lets get to this product.

We use this for our business and sofar have been very happy with this product. Sure there are some times the program offers services that are not included and probably should have been. It is very easy to use and a complete solution for our company. The other competing products are more aggressive with offering paid for addons. Sage 50 is more matter of fact when they offer them so its a bit more palatable. Our accountant loves this program because he uses it every day. I use it to check the reports he generates. We can import CSV files into the program fairly easily and this allows for faster integration of our data.

Pros:
+ Easy to use
+ Easy to install
+ Import data easily
+ Nice looking reports
+ Mostly complete

Cons:
- Payroll addon (come on shouldnt these be included???)
- Other addons that should also be included for the price.

Overall we will continue to use this software. The other alternative is just not worth the hassle and aggressive tactics.

Thanks for reading my review.",0
"I prefer Trend Micro to MacAfee, Norton and other protection software. After years of fighting with protection software, it was a pleasure to use Trend Micro, which provides me the security I need without the compatibility headaches so common with this type of software.

Trend Micro AntiVirus + AntiSpyware allows you to send and receive email and share files with protection from malicious viruses, Trojan horse programs, and spyware. This product does not provide Internet security. For full protection, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trend-Micro-Internet-Security-Pro-3-0/dp/B002EAYJEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trend Micro Internet Security Pro 3.0</a>.

For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I look for three things:

1. Easy to install and easy to use
2. Operates without slowing down my laptop
3. The software works; viruses and spyware are stopped before they cause trouble.

Trend Micro meets all of those expectations. I wrote a five-star review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trend-Micro-Antivirus-Antispyware-2009/dp/B001CPJHGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware 2009</a>, but noted that this is a basic level of security. Too often, consumers confuse the basic protection packages with the ""Pro"" versions.

BTW: Earlier this year I switched from IE to Firefox, which eliminated the frozen screens and slow Internet surfing I had been experiencing. I recommend Trend Micro and Firefox together, especially if you spend a lot of time conducting business on the Internet.",0

The product itself contains several useful tools to help you get started. There are the three levels of CD-ROM software that can be installed both Mac and PC, a microphone (that can be used with many other applications), the guide and then the multiple CDs that you can play at home, in your car or anyplace you carry your MP3 player (I particularly enjoyed these).

Functionally, this product is exceptional as it allowed me to learn how to spell and write, speak without following a script, strategies to learn and retain what I learned for a long time. With simple practice, I learned how to ask what is your age, simple greetings, finding directions, telling the time of day and using correctly past, present and future tense. If you are as diligent as I am, you'll learn in no time how to order food in restaurants, express ideas and comprehend terms from the daily life, such as the news from the media.

I never saw that before.  Then I saw a bunch of attack screens pop up.  I'm like, seriously?  You just did that because you saw the Norton in my pocket.

Before I could install this, I had to update my OS X.  I have been ignoring, or doing my best to ignore 10.7 Lion.  I can fly with 10.6 and sometimes these upgrades seem gratuitous, especially with all the problems this one reportedly caused.  But it was worse than that because Apple wouldn't let me go up one step.  The word I am thinking of starts with a B, has 8 letters, and rhymes with astards.  I had to go up to 10.8.

Then finally, I was able to start the Norton Internet Security. Something that should have taken five minutes took over an hour.  Why is it that I have so much difficulty doing simple things?  I had done the upgrade to 10.8, against my will, but nevertheless.  This should have been a breeze.  This is NORTON!

The first error was that I could not run a scan because the program I JUST installed could not load the scan engine because it needed to be updated.  REALLY?  I just updated it.  THREE minutes ago.  Neither could I slide the simple on button of virus protection.  I just got error readings that told me I needed to do a Live Update that wouldn't run because I JUST did it.

I have 91 messages like this pending:

Norton AntiVirusError
AntiVirus Auto-Protect could not load the scan engine.
Please run LiveUpdate to get the latest version.

I know that it is faster for Rajesh and all his counterparts to use a remote control on my computer to get it to work and my degree of frustration had me let him.  I LOLed very loudly when I saw the same things happened to him for awhile.  He finally just deleted everything Norton from my computer and reinstalled it.  He was very polite but my computer still had to be invaded to get this program to work.

It should be easier.  I want to be able to think: Yes, put this on my computer and have it be done.",0
"I've used NIS for the past several years and have been very happy with its performance.  I know I can get cheaper or even free security tools, but I honestly don't mind paying for good software.  However, I'm always on the hunt for good deals and NIS is often available for a very low price or even free after rebates.  You just have to keep your eyes peeled, then jump on it when you see the deals.  The thing is, you are buying the license, so you can use the new license to renew your subscription when your current one expires.  You're free to update the software to the latest version at any time after it's been released.

NIS takes up minimal resources on my PC, which has 16GB of RAM.  I like that after you've installed it and set up a few preferences, it runs in the background without any further interaction required.  I also like that I can install the same license on three machines, since I have more than one Windows PC.  Digging around the interface can get a little confusing and I think it could use a redesign to be more intuitive, but again, I rarely have to mess with it so it's not that big of a deal to me.

If you want a powerful, set-it-and-forget-it security program for your Windows PC, Norton Internet Security is a great option.",0
"I was curious about this product, since I am a faithful user of the McAfee SiteAdvisor Firefox addon, which is free.

This product installed immediately, and I couldn't find anything new that it offered me. This program acts as a surreptitious bar down on your internet browser toolbar that uses a color coded system of letting you know when you are browsing user reported safe sites or bad ones. I find this product EXTREMELY useful for all users, advanced or novice, because you never know when you do happen to stumble on a website that is loaded with viruses and spyware. This program acts as an alert to tell you which one you are in fact visting.

It doesn't take up any CPU, that I can tell, and it does have a community feature that allows you to view what others have written about the site and why they thought it was good or bad. I think maybe I would just stick with the free add on that is offered on the web versus paying for this, because I did not see anything that was new with the ""Plus"" program.

Regardless, I recommend everyone to have this SiteAdvisor on every computer you own, this is coming from someone who has had to format countless times because of virus and spyware absconding into depths that my virus/spyware programs couldn't find.

Great Product.",0

"Quickly create, edit and publish almost any modern video source or format onto DVD and Blu-Ray discs with the easy navigate Roxio Creator NXT3.

Installation
Installing Roxio Creator NXT3 is a simple process.  You can install this on a netbook but you will need an external USB DVD drive to read the installation disc.  To get the most use out of the software, make sure you choose a complete install.  You will need to input the license key so keep the DVD sleeve with the box for future reinstallation.

"I've used this TurboTax version for as long as e-filing has been available. It really makes the yearly federal and state income tax filing about as easy as it can be.  The program makes improvements in usability and filing procedures with each iteration.
That said, the program doesn't do everything: the user MUST keep good records.  If you don't have the information and understand how to enter it -- the latter is pretty simple now -- no tax program or human tax preparer can help you.  You must learn what to keep and how to keep it so that you can find it easily at tax filing time. That's the key.
I've never been aware of any errors that TurboTax has made compiling my taxes.  The federal e-filing is simple and fast.  My state has a rather strange and awkward free e-filing service based on .pdf forms that you fill in manually (really!) from the data calculated by TurboTax.

"McAfee Total Protection with Site Advisor Plus provides a lot of value to home PC users. At an affordable cost, you can protect and manage up to 3 PCs with an impressive array of preventative maintenance and network administration tools. Importantly, you gain the peace of mind knowing that the software you are using is from McAfee, who for years has been recognized as a leader in security software solutions for business.

There are 12 main components to the product. These include software to help stop viruses, hackers, spyware and junk email. System administration tools include maintenance, file backup and restoration as well as tools for network configuration, file sharing and printing. Using an Internet connection, the software is continuously refreshed with updates so that you are protected from the latest threats.

I especially like the Site Advisor Plus feature which allows you to add a button to your browser's toolbar. When visiting a website, you can easily obtain a detailed status report of the site. The report includes an analysis of download tests for adware, spyware and other potential troublesome software; the number of emails you might expect to receive per month if you opt-in to a mail list; annoyances such as excessive use of popups; a schematic displaying the online affiliations of the site; and reviewer comments about the site. This nifty tool is immensely valuable when visiting a website for the first time and deciding how you might want to interact with the site, if at all.

The installation process was easy using a PC running MS Vista. I have since used McAfee to automate the process of backing up files to an external drive; the security updates are downloading automatically; and I frequently tuen to the Site Advisor tool for insight. In my opinion, the availability of these essential services in an easy-to-use package can save any home computer user the time and hassle of system maintenance, and consequently improve the home PC ownership experience.

I highly recommend this essential product to everyone.",0

"I have been using the Corel PaintShop Pro software since its earliest version and it is still the main photo-editing software I use everyday among other photo-editing software including the PhotoShop. What I like about the Corel PaintShop Pro software are its ease of use and the wealth of features for general quick /easy and the more advanced photo editing.

Here are some of the features I use most often for quick editing :

- smart photo fix : allows a 1-click photo enhancement with real time review and adjustment to our liking
- various photo brushes (clone brush, scratch remover etc) for quick touch-up of the photos
- white balance adjustment for the perfect color balancing
- skin smoothing which makes us look years younger

The software comes with a wealth of advanced features including layering, masking, vector objects, stack filters, raw processing and a variety of photo effects.

This latest version is noticeably faster including the program start-up and the more CPU intensive tasks like skin smoothing and such. It also comes with new features such as magic move which allows us to move an object with an intelligent algorithm to fill the background. There are also bonus CDs including the Perfect Effects, Corel AfterShot, Perfectly Clear SE, and creative collection which enhance our capabilities for photo editing.

"It is a complex tool but it is the best one available for individuals to track your expenses, investments, assets and budget planning.

I decided to upgrade from Q Premier 2014 because it had some new tools that looked important: Morningside X-Ray to analyze investment portfolio allocations and also a valid FICO credit score report that I did not absolutely need, but one that I was curious about. I had absolutely no interest in their smart phone app. Usually I upgrade every 3 years when forced to in order to keep doing downloads from financial institutions. This time, I wanted to use the new tools.

Because I have been using Quicken for many years, I knew better than trying to do an upgrade as soon as the 2015 version was released. Quicken always has had serious and damaging bugs with every new release. In the past I would wait until patches R4 or R5 before even thinking of doing and upgrade. That meant February or so after the September release. This time, the reviews seems to say that Quicken had really improved their software support and quality control and that R3 was stable.

I upgraded at the end of December this was a little early, but everything seems to be working well.

Here is how I upgraded:
 1. I purchased and downloaded directly from the Quicken web site to make sure I got the most current fixes.
 2. I ran the update. It uninstalled Q 2014, installed Q 2015, rebooted my PC and said it would convert my data the first time I ran Q 2015.
 3. The upgrade and conversion was fast. The data conversion took less than 1 minute.
 4. I did not see any conversion errors.
 5. After the data conversion finished Q said there was an update which it did. Apparently, the version I downloaded was R2 and the conversion worked in R2. I am now running R3.
 6. Morningstar X-Ray seems useful.
 7. Financial institution downloads seem to work well and maybe a little faster than R2.
 8. Reports look the same. That is a disappointment. Their analysis reports really need improvement in the way they treat taxes for the various Retirement account. Basically, they ignore taxes and simply add your pre-tax assets to your IRA assets and also your Roth IRA taxes. That is like adding apples to oranges and bananas. And counting them all as ""fruit objects"".

The go back to a previous date feature is tremendously useful for when something goes wrong, but I could do without the snoop-doggy-dog in the file search section. Looks a bit unprofessional to me. It's also good to be able to use the familiar Windows themes instead of the XP ones, if you want to.
Users of the latest graphics cards and Adobe multimedia applications will have to upgrade to XP to have the required system support, or even get an installation to proceed. Be sure to check this before buying anything current. Avid DV Express, etc, is also only XP compatible.
Any hardware such as printers, scanners, modems, etc install very easily.
An anti-virus and firewall are essential additions, Sophos and Kerio Personal Firewall work well for me. Also be sure to never be on the web in Administrator mode. Instead, set yourself up as a user with Power User attributes.  A Restricted User profile is also available, but if you have Screenwriter 2000, or other Screenplay products installed, they may not launch or function properly.
XP Pro will give a great deal of satisfaction. XP-Home is much less expensive, but is little better than Win 98.",0
"I started with Windows 3 and upgraded myself past the much-heralded Windows 95, the Millennium edition, straight through to Vista (which was supposed to eradicate the bad taste that was affixed to the word Windows). After awhile, they all became a blur with features being added, and then dropped, without rhyme or reason. Overall, however, there was nothing that really made it a better version of Windows.

Windows 7 shows proof that Microsoft listened to the customers and decided to give them a product that met their needs.  Windows 7 (I'm referencing the Ultimate version, 64 bit) was a very long install (I upgraded from Vista) clocking in at 5 hours. Immediately I felt a pang of disappointment when it did not keep all of my settings (sounds, image size for folders). However, that was not the end of the world and I promptly forgot about it when I realized that Microsoft gave us Windows 7 and they managed to provide me with two necessary elements where I refused to compromise: the program gave me back disk space so I went from a hard drive almost half full to one that now has 65% disk space free.  Not bad at all. Then, I immediately became aware that this is the first version of Windows where speed is of the essence. Whether rebooting, opening programs (which I can now keep on the bar instead of searching the START menu (you can still pin them there so don't worry)), saving files, etc., Windows 7 moves so fast that my three year old HP notebook was rejuvenated.

Windows 7 does have some bells and whistles: SNAP allows me to open two programs (I tried it with WORD and ONE NOTE) and have them side-by-side. It's easy even though you might not use it frequently. You can also add sticky notes and get a sneek-peek of open programs. Nice.

It isn't often that you upgrade (or even purchase) a program where you immediately notice major differences but Windows 7 not only retains the best features of former Windows programs, it adds benefits to the end user.",0
I have been using this program for years and have been happy with it.  My taxes are not that complicated but I can see that it handles pretty much anything necessary to do taxes.  Will continue to buy especially with great price at Amazon if you keep watching.,0
"I only had 1 joint return to do, so Turbo Tax did what I needed it to do. I'm glad that early purchasers of this product spoke up (loudly) about the issue of paying to print out copies and to do more than 1 return. Luckily, the company listened to the outraged customers and fixed it. A rare occurrence in this day and age. As I mentioned, I only needed to do 1 Federal return so all was well for me. The product seems to get better and easier to use each year. I am able to e-file and do my state return (Indiana) for free through the state of Indiana's Government website so all I needed was this program with the free Federal e-file. Check with you own state to see if your state offers something like that before purchasing this program",0

"I found Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate a very usable video editing program for my modest needs. It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

Hope this helps someone.",0

I was delayed due to upgrades and other software I wanted to use, but once I got everything ready, it was a breeze to blend the Windows components I missed in my routines, and have them ready in a click on my Mac.

No need to restart or shutdown to go to either OS, just go to what you want when you need it.  Very fast processing, and no graphic degradation to speak of.  With the new Mountain Lion, I just feel it's time to upgrade.  And at their list price, it is still a bargain for the headaches it resolves.

So, just in case you ended up here, just shoot over to version 5 instead.  Unless you are in a preferred situation where this would work better for you and your needs.  But there is no reason 5 won't work for you as it is pretty good with adjusting to older programs.",0

"I've been buying this mapping program since it was first offered for sale.  Every time I buy a new version, I ask myself why.  I never notice any changes.  Or at least the features that I use on a regular basis never seem to change.  However, I'm sure that SOMETHING changes...  Like when its direction pointing circled-car icon changed to an arrow.  That was a BIG improvement.

I LOVE this program and the way it operates!  However, it appears that Microsoft really isn't interested in investing much money in its design.  So every 1.5 years, they will make some ""token"" changes in order to get its loyal users to buy a new version. With Google Mapping is becoming so popular, the program is probably not long for this world......",0

"Serif PagePlus Essentials is a cool desktop publishing program. I appreciate that I can quickly get started in making good looking signs and posters without complications or learning curves. It comes with templates you can use for quick projects, but if you want to design something attractive from scratch, you can do that too. I prefer creating from scratch, I find it's sometimes a lot easier to get the effect I want.

At first when I started using PagePlus, I wasn't too sure about it. However, as I've gotten to use it more for making signs for my home or other projects, I've discovered what a wonderful gem PagePlus is. It's also been fun for making signs to post on Pinterest as well.

With all the cool features PagePlus offers to make good looking documents/signs at an incredibly low price, it's worth getting.

My PagePlus works with Window 7 without any problems.",0
"I have been using Quicken since the 1990's.
Bought Quicken 2013 as an upgrade to Quicken 2011. Also bought it a few months after its release (Feb 01) to avoid the usual issues needing patches.
The upgrade is Quicken 2013 R10.
-The install and upgrade was flawless. All data converted 100%.
-The cash flow function (in/out/whats left) was still in the program. Quicken 2011 was a different story, until it was patched back in. This function in my opinion is the best information window in Quicken. It is my opening window. Tied with scheduled transactions it a very effective aid in expense control.
-The budgeting function does seem to be much improved and a bit easier to use.
- Intuit seems to have put a routine in the program to fix issues with ""one step update"" not working/connecting.
It did connect one of my bank accounts, (after asking),  that had been removed because of connection issues.
One step update has been the only major recurring issue I have had with Quicken. The online Tech support has been good at resolving the issue when it occurs. I hope this apparent routine intuit has added goes a long way to resolving the issues with ""one step update"".
-PDA support I do not use at present so I have nothing to report on this new feature.
-Overall its the same core program with no major interface changes, thus no learning curve for existing users.

Overall this is by far the best upgrade experience and least problematic one I have had. It was good that I waited a few months before upgrading to get a great functioning patched (R10) product.
Thank You Quicken team.

Update to this review 3/1/2013
It looks like Quicken 2013 has added a new routine to auto change any passwords in the vault (for one step update) without having to go to the vault and manually change them. If a password has been changed, a pop up window will ask for your new password, and then auto change the vault for you. Great feature.",0

"Corel Painter 2016 is the latest in a series of art-oriented tools for the Mac and PC. My last exposure to Painter was with the X3 version and the newest version has many new features that make Painter even more useful than before.

The user interface resembles Adobe Photoshop and is fairly intuitive for those that have used similar products in the past. The default set of tools lets you get to work right away. While Adobe Photoshop is great for modifying photos, it's rather limited for creating art by itself. Painter gives you access to a wide variety of paints, pens, pencils, brushes and media textures with a workflow that allows you to work more or less naturally. I highly recommend using a tablet instead of a mouse, but either will work.

For those who aren't familiar with similar programs or need some extra help, there are a large number of tutorials available to help you with almost every aspect of the program.

One of my favorite features is the watercolor brushes and paper. Although it's not quite the same as using watercolors, it allows the artist to create art that looks very similar to the real thing. I find it most useful for quick and dirty watercolor renderings of photographs by keeping the original photo down at one layer and ""painting"" over it on another layer. Yes, it's cheating. But it gives a nice result without spending hours of work with physical media. Layers and paths work much as you'd expect.

My only issue with the program is the 'lag' I sometimes get when using broad watercolor brushes and move my 'brush' too quickly. Thank goodness for undo.

Overall, I think that Painter 2016 is a fine program who want to try their hand at more involved digital art, but the sales price when this review was written is rather steep for a casual investment.",0

"When WinXP came out I refused to abandon my reliable Win98SE until SP2 was released and WinXP finally became an operating system (from the experimental eye-candy it first was). Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...

WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!

Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)?
I don't think so!

Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet.  But that is why there are so many Specialized Software available! And, what is even worse, WinVISTA will not let exactly these Software titles function as intended!

Now, this is the UPGRADE edition - which means it is to be installed not on a freshly formated disk but over a pre-existing Windows edition. Read reviews in ANY forum: this is the WORST possible scenario in aspect of software compatibility and hardware drivers.

I had WinVISTA on my Laptop for about a week. I could not format quick enough! There is NOTHING WRONG with my WinXP-SP2. WHY CHANGE THEM?",1

"When I first started fooling around with we pages back in 1994 when the Internet was fresh and new my HTML editor of choice was a simple text editor.  Over the years the Internet has evolved and technology has changed, but I've stuck with a simple text editor for most of my needs.  I tried Microsoft Frontpage back in the day, but felt it was just so bloated and inefficient that it wasn't worth it.  It was with hesitation and a lot of reservations that I finally decided to give Microsoft Expression Web a shot -- and wow, Microsoft has come a long, long way.

First thing about Expression Web is that it's so flexible depending on your skillset.  Are you still working with Frontpage extensions?  No problem!  Are you moving up to using stylesheets?  It will guide you and help you along!  Maybe you run your own site with custom coding -- Expression understands PHP, Javscript and ASP without a problem!  It will even do syntax checking as you write the code.

Even if you are a web guru Expression Web can help you out.  With extensive support for XML, CSS and data sources you will find everything you need to keep your site chugging.

Gone is the inefficient, slow and incompatible features of Frontpage and in is the support for WWW, XML and CSS standards.  You'll love how it can help you not only keep your site compliant with the latest standards, but also how it helps with promoting your site from ""dev"" to ""prod"" with just a few clicks.

I tried Dreamweaver in the past, and found it not only too complicated, but way too expensive.  Expression Web is really going to give Dreamweaver a run for their money -- and their user base.  Once you get the hand of Expression Web you may even find yourelf looking at the other Microsoft Expression products such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Expression-Blend-2/dp/B0013ITQ9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Expression Blend 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Expression-Encoder-2/dp/B0013IRKCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Expression Encoder 2</a>&nbsp;to further expand your web toolkit.",0

"Video editing and authoring is generally an expensive proposition, and while this program is not perfect or professional grade&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Ulead-VideoStudio-11-5-Plus/dp/B0013OAHTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus</a>&nbsp;packs a wallop of features for a VERY good price, at least compared to what this software has historically cost.

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.

Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.

Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.

You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.

In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.

Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.

One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.

Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.

One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.

I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.

Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.

Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.

Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.

Enjoy!!!",0
"Ideally, I would write a review for an anti-virus program after running rigorous tests to subject it to various malware to see how much it detects.  Perhaps you'll understand when I confess that I haven't done anything of the sort.  What I have done is use Kaspersky Anti-Virus for the past few years and have had no issues with viruses.  How much of that is due to the software and how much to my generally being careful about what I download, and from whom?  That's difficult to say, but I'll lay out what little I can actively see about the program.

As far as keeping me safe, Kaspersky does issue warnings to me if I start to go to a website that they have reason to believe is problematic.  I generally take the advice and steer clear of them and haven't had any regrets on that score.  The other major selling point is kind of the opposite side of that coin, namely Kaspersky doesn't pop up all the time with annoying messages that either ask me to do things or tell me that it's done something.  It simply loads in the background whenever I boot the system and quietly does its job.  I've had anti-virus software in the past that was a lot more intrusive so this has been a major plus.

In summary, I don't pretend to be an expert on determining which anti-virus software is the best.  But I use my PC for hours every day and have had zero problems since I started using Kaspersky.  The program is also very well behaved and neither tortures me with popups nor does it interfere with games or other programs as some security packages do.  To the extent I'm able to judge it, there is literally nothing I know of that I wish were different.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good no-hassle anti-virus program.",0

Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.

There are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.

"I am amazed at the negative reviews.

This software installs like a dream, and even if you don't need Norton Utilities, this is the essential software if you have a connection to the internet.

The Anti-virus software gets everything that McAfee fails to get, and is easily update-able. In fact everything about the NIS 2006 is easy to work.

Unless you have some serious  comprehension  issues, then this is a great choice. And I have it operating on a DELL 8200, a Multiboot DELL  8100, and an XPS ( I do have a 3 user License  version).

This is easy to install, as well as uninstall  where necessary, and is a good, and wise choice for safe computer use.",0

"The Corel Suite X4 Installed on my Windows XP Pro system with Service Pack 2 without any problems.  Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.

The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.",0

"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error my executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This H&R Block Deluxe includes only the federal tax return (no State).  This version entitles a person to 5 free federal e-files.  The program allows to print any number of returns without limits, and if you decide to mail returns (instead of e-filing) there no additional fees.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 Adding this point based on a useful question in the comments:  The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"Well, let me tell ya!

This little thing is like an encyclopedia of information.  It's amazingly handy and interesting when you're researching different locations.  More than that, information I might have about places can be thrown on here easily, organized, and used.  Easily.

Manipulating and moving information to other systems, programs, even your cell phone, is trivially easy.  Making routes and scheduling meetings makes a lot of sense.  I never thought of it this way before, but many things on my schedule can be planed on a map now.  I can save time and organize what I'm doing to reduce my traveling.  This is the core of the program: planning things in real space and real time.  You can have a complex plan, simplify what it looks like, and everything is easy to understand and change.

Many aspects of the interface are head smackingly obvious yet huge improvements.  Back and forward buttons on a map.  Great!  Almost like surfing the web.

This is a terrific product and while I usually have a problem with MS's decisions for interfaces, this is really something I would recommend to anyone who would manages information about locations, travels, or just has a busy life.

The best feature is that this is a lot of fun to do.  It certainly doesn't feel like work!",0

I have not filed yet so will update how efile worked when completed.  I was worried that with different look and feel it would take me a while to figure out the software but was surprised how easy it was.  Everything flowed like in TurboTax tax through all areas of tax information entering and verification.  I had no issue moving around the software and in no time I know my tax exposure and can file when I'm ready.  With a price much lower than TurboTax I am glad I made the switch.  I have no reason to go back to TurboTax next year unless H&R block give me a reason to look at TurboTax again come next year.",0

"Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.

As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.

So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).

And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.

Now, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.",0

"I needed to make a basic, simple will (I have no children).  I also wanted to make a simple health care directive, after seeing a loved one suffer for a very long time, with no guiding document to advise his family members about his wishes.  I figure it's never the ones with a will and healthcare directive who actually need them earlier than expected, so I'm viewing it as a good luck charm (haha).  ;-)

The real advantage of this software, however, was in getting my parents to use it as well.  Their last one-paragraph will was written before I was born...and I'm in my 40s!  They now have grandchildren via my brother, who could not be included in the old will, which only mentioned their own current and future children.  (In fact, if my brother happened to predecease or die at the same time as both of my parents, his children and widow would receive nothing at all from their estate, except, of course, voluntarily from me.  This is not a crazy notion, of course, when you consider events such as accidents.)
Anyway, the benefit of this software for me was mainly that I could use and then give the software to my parents -- who also used it.  They never would have bought it on their own, but it would seem like a ""waste"" to not use it if it was just handed to them...so the long-time issue of them not having a current will has now been resolved.
Anyway, the software was very easy to use, even for my tech-not-so-savvy parents in their 70s.  I thought it was very clear.  It had a lot of options for documents I didn't need, but the ones I did were very easy to access.  I'm not terribly concerned about the fact that the laws the software is based on can change and won't be updated for longer than one year -- my will is so simple that there is no real concern that anything could change its effects or alter its intentions significantly.  And of course, a slightly outdated will is infinitely better than one at all...just a good thing to have crossed off the ""to do"" list!",0

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0

"Let me discuss most of the other reviews first, then I will get to mine. It is kind of important for a software company to nail their demographic when making a product. Its just the way it is that most people doing genealogy are going to be older adults. This is because as we get older it is more important to make a link with our time here. There are some younger people doing this to be sure but most I have met are generally older adults. Regarding that I believe they may have made this a tad bit user-unfriendly. If you are well versed in computers then you cannot even see why they are having an issue. Just getting my mother to move one window over another on the desktop takes me 5 minutes and I have been building PC's since the '80s it gets pretty frustrating. My recommendation to this company is to make an interface that mimics something found in an Apple product. Simple intuitive and foolproof.

----------My review-----------
Overview:
Ok lets say I love this software! For the past year I have been putting all of my family history on Ancestry. It has been pretty good with regard to finding details out that I might not know. The main issue I have with Ancestry is the monthly cost. With this software you get 3 months deluxe US, which is almost 2x the cost of this product, for that alone its worth it.

Reports:(+)
So what makes this software so great? The reports mostly. I have one branch of my tree go back to 1060. Thats more than can be shown on any tree available from Ancestry. The farthest you can go on the web is around 3 generations not 25 generations. With the reporting tools on this software you can get a variety of reports that flesh out your family. Ones such as marriage report listing whom everyone was married to. A generation report listing who was born under whom. Honestly there are too many to list here, each one is a very unique way to view a part of the story.

Seamless integration with Ancestry:(+)
I lost not a single bit of data transferring it from the web down to my computer. All I did was log into ancestry from Family Tree Maker and it drew down all of the data in a GENCOM file. Once in the software it populated a local database with over a years worth of work. With my personal experience this was pretty great.

Trees:(+/-)
Along with reports the trees available are all great tools for showing your family. I mean the software is Family Tree Maker it should also print out the trees. It does with some great designs. Unfortunately the trees on the software are also limited. I believe you can go back max 6 generations but then it stops. The designs are pretty good to show different relationships. Overall I would have liked more generations, knowing the tree would be physically huge but that is what I want to show.

Manual: (-)
Holy cow! This is the most convoluted huge tome I have seen in a very long time for a manual. My advice; skip it. Nice effort on their part to add it but it makes even opening the box a daunting appearing task that might scare more users than help them.

Summary: (+/-)
If you are a versed internet user/ computer operator you can expect this software to perform as an essential at-home addition to the work you have done on Ancestry. If you are just starting out on this journey it might be better for you to use the website first and then start using the software. Their website has much of the same interface and use along with other family members you may not know providing key pieces to your tree. I don't think of this as a solo tool but instead as an augmentation of another (Ancestry). As that, it excels.

Thank you for reading my review.",0
"As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios.",0
"Strangely, it does not appear to say 2014 on the packaging, but it is indeed and works great. I have been using Bit Defender for about 3 years and I like it a lot.
I have previously had bad experiences dealing with their customer service in India but other that I like it a lot.
If you but the retail package, I suggest you download the latest version form their web-site and then use the serial number included in your packaging to activate it. If you ordered the software online, you don't need to wait for it to come, just download the software and use it as a trial version until your package arrives!

I definitely recommend this product, it is a cut about many of its competitors!",0

"This review is being written by someone who has never been mistaken for anything other than someone who can pick up a pen or pencil and scribble something. I cannot draw or make anything resembling a realistic visualized image that has been converted for other people to view. This program however allowed me to create realistic paintings that did a better job than my hand otherwise would have if someone were to give me a paintbrush.

I'm not saying this should take the place of paint and canvas or that it was the paintbrushes' fault. No but this program allows someone with no talent in this art form, like me, to be guided a little better to what fits me as I try to recreate anything on the screen.

For instance the multifarious functions that allow you to change which kind of stroke to use or the method of the stroke (watercolors, paintbrush, pencil) acted a portable art studio with everything at my disposal. I previously had no real knowledge of the different types of things that I could use. This program had it all in front of me (with help menus I might add) that taught me along the way as I learned to use this program.

I used just a mouse (no stylus) so my precision was probably hindered a bit, although I don't think having more control would have helped me much, remember I am not a visual artist. So in essence I'm speaking for people out there that want the bare minimum of this program in that you are buying solely the program itself.

Great aspects of program:
- Has every brush stroke I could think of, with all sizes and shapes to use in an instance
- Has a color palette allowing you to choose any color or mix thereof to suit your need
- Even with a mouse, I was able to create very succinct precision, surprisingly
- Acts as an art studio and art teacher, in that if you haven't caught on to how to make paintings through conventional means this program actually acts as a guide that may be easy to learn from then other forms

Obviously you know that this review is not for the professional for I am just an average everyday software junkie who has no knowledge or art or drawing or programs thereof. I can say, however, that this program was smooth to install, extremely easy to use and taught me some things about drawing on a computer I was never aware of. For that matter, it allowed me to do things with a ""virtual"" paintbrush I never thought I could do. So if there is a budding or curious artist in your, I suggest this program will get you there quicker than a complete art studio would. Of course you are saving much more money too.",0
"Hello, Says it can make my laptop run faster. I tried it and it did. It claims it is easy to use. Yes, it is easy to use. It claims it won't make a mess of my laptop. Right again. I used the easy button and believe the claims the developer made are accurate. UPDATE I installed this on my 64bit OS and soon received a message from the developer informing me that I need to discontinue Win cleaner on the 64bit OS. Due to reports of inflicting damage to the OS. I've been attributing the 64bit OS problems to MS updater loading the AMD 64 drivers on to my desktop w/Intel processor. Side Note...MS is really getting to be pain in my butt! UPDATE Wincleaner is a type of software that gets well...stolen. My KAV burned me and I in the end nuke the drive. I asked the software developer if I could have another shot at loading the software because unlike modern software that has the ability to recognize that it is back on the same computer (FAIR USE CLAWS) this software will not recognize the fact the it's reinstalled on the same computer. I call that stealing back the product.",0

"Installed perfectly on Windows XP. Imported last years tax data perfectly.

Manually downloaded information from all my financial institutions, using the correct import file that the firms make available for manual import. (Not the import button in Turbo Tax)

IMPORTANT!  Remember to get the correct file from your broker since the import function button in Turbo Tax does not import your cost basis for stock or options. Unless you do, you will have to fill this out yourself.  Talk about time, and time is money..Get the right file!

I find that there really is no need to buy the more expensive version, this product does schedule C for my business and home office. I used the Home and Business last year and quite frankly found very little difference in the product. Annoyingly, Turbo Tax kept asking me to upgrade.

This year I knew that e-filing would cost and I gladly paid for it since I was afraid of the IRS's human/scan error in transcribing and I only paid $29 for Turbo Tax with State this year from Amazon.

Received my State Refund in a week, and I my Federal Refund in 2 weeks. No extra costs, deposited right into my bank account.

I still use the forms function to fill in most information, since that is quickest.

ItsDeductable software is useless, time consuming and I question the high amounts it gives to used, very good condition clothing. For my purposes, I claim 10% of the new purchase price for a deduction. If a suit cost $125, the donation is $12.50. Come on guys, I've worn the suit--How can it be worth $65? Maybe this is why Turbo Tax sells extra audit protection?  Since I did not pay for ITsDeductable, I still give Turbo Tax Five Stars this year.

"I'm not a professional photographer. Not even close. And I'm not a hobbyist either.  I just wanted a tool that would help me make my family and personal photos look good. I also have some ancient family photos I've scanned.

Since the interface looked foreign to me, I watched several of the tutorial videos before starting. This is a really powerful tool.

While I won't need many of AfterShot's powerful features, I can appreciate the ones that make my photos look nice. Just changing contrast and lighting makes a huge difference. For restoring old photos, a bit of noise reduction and adjusting the exposure does wonders. Then a bit of color correction really punches it up.  Though I'm a newbie, I feel very powerful as I watch 20 to 100 year old photos come back to life.",0

"I was using Norton Ghost to do backups and while that seemed to work okay, I really wasn't comfortable using a Norton/Symnatec product because I've found them all to be bloatware. So I gave Acronis a try.  I set it up using Windows XP and had no trouble installing the program, nor adjusting the settings to make my initial backup as well as scheduling regular incremental backups thereafter. I used the feature of the software that creates a secured partition on the backup drive that can't be accessed by the operating system.  This partition does appear to be secure because Windows Explorer doesn't see it, and it is immune to the format command, as well.

The backups ran as scheduled, no problem.  Then I upgraded to Vista, using a clean install, rather than backing up the old and restoring on the new because I wanted to clean out some stuff that I no longer wanted. Acronis installed just as easily on Vista, no problems.

Couple of things: One, Acronis has more flexibility with scheduling regular tasks than does Ghost, and has more features as well. Second, I have not actually had to use the restore function yet; I have only been backing up my discs but not restoring anything.  So this review is qualified in that sense because I can't tell you if it does what it is supposed to do.  But so far, everything I had done has worked smoothly and the instructions are easy enough to follow.  I would recommend this as a backup solution.",0

"I have been a TurboTax user for years; in fact, I just checked and I have TurboTax files from 1999!
This, the Basic edition, does not come with a state editionwhich is a let-down for me since I live in a state which requires a state tax return.
The installation is very straightforward and since I am already a TurboTax user from years past, it is very easy to import last year's files and everything is filled out already. Very handy, especially if your work situation has remained the same.

I have found TurboTax to extremely thorough for 99% of the situations; it goes through just about every possible scenario and the only time I would suggest hiring a professional is if you are in a very complicated situation, with wills, trusts, retirement accounts and so forth, but I would still attempt to use TurboTax to serve as a check on the professional's work. Yes, it is that good.

Filing is easy, free, and straightforward. You're kept abreast of every step (the IRS has accepted your return, etc.) and are notified by email and text. Documentation can be accessed at any time, and it's copious. Even complicated tax information is clearly documented if you are willing to take the time to read. For the DIY-er, TurboTax is a boon, best in class.

TurboTax has taken everything into consideration, it even helps you estimate the value of donated items. A very rigorous error checking takes place before you file; it also includes the risk you run of getting audited while offering (paid) services to help you if the risk is high.

It is easy to download.  And, I have never seen such long key numbers for entry, but fear not, if you lose your place, you are prompted if you made an error.

I don't think the average person will know how to work this software.  The online tutorials are very helpful, explaining what each section on the interface screen does.  But, aside from that, it has a ton of info, and interactive buttons to select.

So, if you struggle with average software, and don't have experience doing this, you will struggle for sure.  This software is for the experienced, and I am not the experienced ......Rizzo",0

"Long-time Photoshop user here, and I have to tell you that I am impressed with how far Corel has brought its suite of graphics software in the few years since I've used it.  In spite of it being a suite, it isn't bloated with a lot of specialized applications.  You get a good, solid image handling program, a vector-based drawing program and a screen cap one.  No website builders, 3D stuff or video applications which are likely to take up a ton of space on your hard drive and never be used.

In many ways I find the drawing program better than anything I've seen from Adobe.  The controls are far more intuitive.  And in fact, since one of the ways I judge how well a program performs is by how easy it is to get it up and running at a basic level without reading any of the manuals, I'd have to say that in many ways the whole suite is as good or better than Adobe's offerings in the intuition department.  If you can handle Photoshop, you can certainly learn Corel fairly quickly.

There's a lot I could say, but I'd prefer to recommend that you check the program info on this page and see if it sounds like something you can use.  I don't think you'll be disappointed in the quality, nor do I believe you'll be defeated by the learning curve.  I think you'll find this suite well worth having either on its own or as an addition to the graphics programs you already use.",0
"I've been using this for a couple months now, and have found that I have actually eliminated many other programs that I used to use, as this suite is so chock full of content, everything else seems obsolete.

There is a lot going on here, as this version of CorelDRAW is the cream of the crop.  It works very well with the Windows 7 interface, and is fully customizable.  Install only what you need, but if you're like me, I dabble in most everything it offers for subject matter.

I have designed web sites for years, and through these years, there have been many fill-in-the-blank type web site creators.  The web site creation feature alone is worth the money, and perfect if you are not no familiar with programming. In my case, I liked creating with this feature, but the ability to edit anything I want. However, it comes with so many templates and images, you are good to go for your first ever web site, if that is the case.  Soon you will add more to your sites with the Swish program, adding flash animations and text.

Photographers will not only adapt well to the image creation and editing features, but will appreciate the organization of a huge collection of work that would otherwise be hard to navigate.  If you have a mess of photos, and not a pro, even better.  It helps you get to a higher level as you save much higher quality work.

Video Studio is perfect for the aspiring YouTube star that wants to take their audience to the next level. But with the resources and features provided, you could become an avid filmmaker. And if you are already a pro making movies, this program simply makes a lot of aspects much easier. The video effects and the ease of adding music and textual elements are top notch.  And everything is easily uploaded directly from the program, or you can create a stunning DVD presentation.

There are plenty of tools and features that you may think you will not use, but once installed, you will be noticing that these elements are merely incorporated in your work.  The portability of files and sharing is much easier with the industry standard in WinZip Pro which will become your default choice in file compression.  But you will appreciate the organization ability of all these programs on your system with customized toolbars, thumbnail and preview features, and there is no reason to be overwhelmed with the fear of having to learn it all.  If you are like me, you learn by doing. But the fact that there is over two hours of training videos on DVD as well as a plethora of helpful resources on their web sites, this has got to be the user-friendliest suite for the artist in anyone.  I highly recommend this for children as well. If there is a glimmer of an artist in their eye, this is worth the investment.",0
"Update 3/4/15: My HP Pav. Elite  running Win7 Pro died and I was loaded this Win. 7 package, essentially resurrecting it.

And I've very little to say about the experience, except that I loaded the DVD, followed the screen prompts, and now the laptop is running Windows 7 which I like almost as much as XP.

You can also convert your files to pdf. I wanted to send a book I'd copied to a friend.

"I have always had good luck with McAfee products, and although the founder of the company is now being sought as a murder suspect, it doesn't mean his software is not solid.

"I've long looked to Ulead VideoStudio as the best amateur video editing software out there, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to compare this package to those I've used in the past, namely the ubiquitous Windows Movie Maker and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roxio-Easy-Media-Creator-Suite-10/dp/B000UJUJ7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10</a>.  I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.

It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.

The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one ""audio"" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.

VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.

As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.

The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package.",0
"I love Kaspersky for my computers, so simply had to give it a try on my phone. I love it's ""lojack"" and ability to lock down and discreetly take the thief's photo should my cell get stolen.  I also love the malware and virus protection, it cleeaned a problem I was having right up.  Highly recommended!",0
"I'm been using all different kinds of software on my PC's for ripping and burning CD's. I make a lot of home movies of family and friend events and this program helps me rip my old home video DVDs and then edit them in a separate program.  Of course it helps that I have a really good PC, built for photo and video editing. This program runs smoothly for me. But it all depends on what you want to use this software for, and the performance of the PC you will be installing the software on.

Since I did not have prior versions or any other ripping/burning software on my PC, Nero installed without any issues. I'm running Windows 7 Pro. As someone mentioned, you may run into issues if you have prior versions. You may need to completely remove the prior installation in order for Nero to install correctly.

The Blu-ray player worked fine for me. I have yet to test the 3D capability. I need to get a 3D monitor first.
The launch window is similar to the Windows 8 design. I don't like Windows 8, which is why I stick with 7, but there's not much I can do except get used to the launch window.

I did convert some short home videos to be played on my Kindle and iPad and it worked fine. But those devices can also play the files without being converted.

Overall, I really like Nero 2014 Platinum. But like I said, your results may vary based on your PC performance, prior installations, and what you plan on using the software for. I've been using it for mainly playing movies and creating files for mobile devices. When I test the other capabilities or run into issues, I will update the review.",0

"WinZip 18 is the latest version of the popular zip and compression software from Corel. While there are many free and shareware options available, they aren't always compatible with many systems. 7-Zip, a popular option was used by my company. I had to stop using it because everyone I sent zip files to could not open or read anything compressed with 7-Zip even though many had the program installed on their computers. We never had this problem using WinZip. It is a standard that does work well with virtually any program. I didn't see a large amount of difference between version 17 as opposed to version 18. It is still fast and efficient. I do love the integration with the cloud services. WinZip will zip to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive (formerly Skydrive from Microsoft), Box, SugarSync and CloudMe. It will also zip to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It also will encrypt your files for protection. The Cloud navigation has been improved, though it was always easy for me to access my Cloud zips before. You can also send links to you zip files in the Cloud if you need to share them. I also love the fact that you can create PDF files from WinZip and add watermarks. That is a great option if you don't have a PDF creator available. You can also create self-extracting zip files for those who don't have a zip program. It handles the usual RAR, 7-Zip, BZ2 and many others. When extracting encrypted files WinZip does auto wipe the temporary files for protection One new feature are the WinZip Express Add-Ons. The new Add-Ons are available for Windows Explorer (in Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows 8 has replaced Explorer with OneDrive), photos, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint (Enterprise option for work) and photos. As is normal for Corel, only the Add-On for Explorer is free to registered users of WinZip 18. The other options are $12.95 with a discount for registered users of $9.95 at the time of this writing. Although I find WinZip to be the best service for zipping, compressing and encrypting files that I have used, Corel charges for everything now, upgrades to Pro, extra charges for the Add-Ons. I am certain these were separated because inclusion would have made the program more costly and everyone does not need as many features. WinZip has also ballooned to include a wide variety of services besides the base product and you will hear about those after you register your email address (required). It is still the best overall for regular consumers and the easiest to use that works with nearly everything. I still highly recommend it since I have tried several other compressions that are too complicated to use and/or others were not able to read the compressed files. Zipping, compressing and encryption do word much faster and easier with WinZip.",0
"while I usually write my reviews the old-fashioned way, I thought it fitting that I 'speak' this review using the product itself. Dragon naturally speaking Premier is speech recognition software from Microsoft Windows products. Amazon provided a group of us with copies in order to give our honest opinions of the product.

The package comes with a headset with an adjustable boom microphone, the installation DVD and some documentation. After reading the documentation, I installed the software on my Macintosh running Windows 7 under VMware fusion seven Pro.

I would've preferred a native Macintosh product, but VMware is usually quite good at these sorts of applications, so I have the utmost confidence that the Dragon software will perform the same on native Windows systems.

To use Dragon, one must speak in a clear, even tone and to 'say' the punctuation as one speaks. Naturally, this takes some getting used to, but it seems quite good at recognizing spoken punctuation.

Dragon allows the user to specify if they have any sort of accent when they speak, such as standard, British, Indian, Pakistani, Australian, etc. There is also the option of selecting one's vocabulary size and which speech recognition method to use.
Once the accent is selected, the user chooses the input method and is then asked to recites text containing tips on the use of the software in order to fine-tune how well the software works.

Once the software is active, the user is able to control it by saying phrases like ""wake up double quote and double quote stop listening to me"" this makes the package quite simple to use and for people with limited mobility may make life much easier.

Overall I am very impressed with Dragon naturally speaking software, although it does take some practice to become proficient. Until the user is completely at east (was supposed to be ""ease"") with the product, I recommend going back and proofreading the words that are dictated because things like a, will end up in speech if one is not careful our mom mom mom (I was saying 'uhm') on (in) the dictated text.",0
"Norton Internet Security 2002 is one of the best solutions for Internet protection available. Besides getting a top-notch virus checker, you also get a firewall, privacy setting and a parental control to block out sites from children.
The firewall is quite powerful. After installing, I went out to a web site which tests your firewall by trying to hack (without intention to damage) your PC. It passed with flying colors and none of the hacking methods made it through.
Sure, someday someone will find a way around but, but NIS also comes with LIVEUPDATE. This will download the latest updates for all aspects of NIS automatically or by your request.
This version works with all CURRENT Windows versions except 95 and earlier. If you are going to upgrade to XP, this is an excellent add on. A+.",0

"After trying various security software, I reached the conclusion Kaspersky was the best.  But now I think Bitdefender is as good, and possibly even better.  This Bitdefender security suite downloaded, installed and updated with no problems.  Unlike my Kaspersky, which was just the anti-virus version, the Bitdefender has a firewall and does PC maintenance, too.  It also blocks others from sharing, if you have an unsecured wireless network.  Like Kaspersky, I also think it discovers more threats than other security software.  And this version of Bitdefener lasts two years and covers three PCs!  What could be better?",0
Received as expected,0
"Great service, great product. It does everything I need it to. Arrived in good time and price was right. good deal.",0
"I've had Kaspersky on three of our home PCs for the past year and have been very pleased with the software.  I replaced their ""standard"" version with this version (PURE, Total Security) and have had it running for about a month now.  The installation was simple (if you have previous version like I did, make sure you uninstall it first) and only took about ten minutes. It automatically seeks the newest updates and installs them.

What I liked best about this version was the parental controls.  Not a lot of other software has this, and with a 13-year old and a 9-year-old in the house, both very active on the PC, I feel better being able to limit cites they can access and being able to monitor which cites they have visited. Besides this feature, the other features that this version offers that the ""standard"" Kaspersky Internet Security Software does not are:

1.  A control center, that lets you manage the security of all PCs on your home network from one source
2.  A password manager, that accesses key cites (like banking) with a very secure password, while the one you remember through Kaspersky can be more simple
3.  The ability to schedule automatic backups to an external hard drive or a USB drive, to protect your more important files
4.  The ability to encrypt your more sensitive data
5.  A ""file shredder,"" to ensure that your more sensitive files are totally removed
6.  Free technical support, which admittedly I have not tried (have not needed to)

In summary, I highly recommend this software. It is, IMO, the best out there in providing a full spectrum of protection while not taking up a lot of disc space or being intrusive as you work from your PC.",0
Have always used TurboTax for my tax prep. work. I don't believe someone should have to pay to have their taxes done and TurboTax fills that bill. My taxes are somewhat complicated and TurboTax fills that bill.,0
"Just like Windows 7 Ultimate for my dual-booting Intel Macs, Windows 7 Professional on my former Vista laptop makes for a great Internet access terminal from the comfort of our futon. It also makes for a great secondary Windows 7 laptop for trips to my Aunt Wilda and Uncle Eay's house. When we are there it sits in their living room with an external Microsoft mouse and it is perfect for that too.

You see, I insist on optimum software for my computers, so that they can do everything I need. Windows Vista Home Premium on that laptop just was not providing it. It wasn't as terrible as some people say it is, because I spent more money for better hardware. But there were times when I wanted to take it back-and one time I almost did. They didn't accept it though, and that was most fortunate as it turned out.

And yes, I found out that Windows Vista Home Premium couldn't be upgraded in place to Windows 7 Professional. But unlike some people, I had seen that, for me at least, Windows 7 was worth the hassle, and sure enough it has been.

I use Office 2007 on the Professional laptop as well as the Ultimate MacBook Pro, and it has pleased me to all get out. I however don't have any more resources for legal Office 2007, so the iMac will get 2010 Professional through that student offer once I get enough money. Windows 7 and Office 2007, especially on the Professional laptop, seems to be plenty sufficient though-Daddy is the resident March Madness Bracketologist at his workplace and Windows 7 Professional amd Office 2007 Professional's cooperation has really benefited him in that.

I love being able to Remote Desktop the Windows 7 laptop from the iMac or MacBook Pro, although I might have to try Windows Live Mesh from Windows Live Essentials to see if it can remote desktop in Aero like on the commercials.

I like Windows 7 Professional on the former Windows 7 laptop just as much as I do Windows 7 Ultimate on the Intel Macs, considering their respective purposes. Their roles are different, but each fulfills it's role perfectly, and Windows 7 Professional facilitates that in a way Windows 7 Home Premium just wouldn't.

Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:

I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.

I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.

I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.

Update 2-3-2014:

Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.

Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.

For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.

End Update 2-3-2014

Update 2-21-2014:

The laptop I feared was dead just needed someone to show it was still important and cared for. Once done, it's now back working and let me tell you, I don't care that the laptop I'm currently running this copy of Windows 7 Professional on is 32-bit only and is a Pentium Dual-Core version of a Core Duo with 2GB of memory. I will take it and leave Windows 8 regular edition craptops for those who feel like playing with their digital lives.

Me? I want something that no matter how old, was highly regarded upon release, and not a zoo's worth of headaches from the underpinnings to the bifurcated UI and everything in the middle.

Windows 7 Professional may not have all the features it did when I initially penned this review, but the inexcusable waste of Windows 7 profits to release the Vista 2.0 that is 8 saddens me. It's not quality. And when the interior of the OS is rotten, there's only so much painting the outside edifice of the OS can do.

As a Windows 7 user in the post-Sinofsky era, I can attest to getting the supposedly Windows 8 exclusive of .NET Framework 4.5 in 4.5 SP1 implementation on Windows 7, thus showing that while Windows 8 may have more powerful hardware, you know the fusion of mobile and desktop means more apps running simultaneously and that means systems that had plenty of RAM for a compelling desktop experience in Windows 7 (witness this laptop) suddenly are getting out of memory errors with Windows 8-it's like trying to install Vista Home Basic (not Home Premium, because Home Premium has Aero which Windows 8 of any edition lacks because Microsoft felt it was ""obsolete"" when in reality I still measure a Windows XP or later computer's worth by ""Is it able to display Aero and do so with full 7 drivers?""

This laptop I am posting today's update on may not be much, but I wouldn't take the most popular HP laptop with 8 on Amazon for it, no matter how positive the reviews may be.

End Update 2-21-2014.

Update 2-27-2014:

I configured a spare 1TB hard drive in a $400 Gateway PC that had received a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium from the Family Pack to be a remote network backup destination for my Windows 7 PCs (since the Time Capsule was designed primarily for Macs, which it's cross-platform support is not really there, at least as of the revision that was most compatible with my main Mac, even though it's 2008 vintage) and Windows 7 Professional is busy backing up along with Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade and full install on the other two main PCs, and I am surprised at how easy it was.

A similar update will be posted under Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade.

End Update 2-27-2014

Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):

Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:

I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!

I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?

I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!

I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.

"I was not able to review this product thoroughly, because between the time I requested it and the time it arrived, my computer was sabotaged, and the hard drive fried.  I am now using a much older computer that does not meet the system requirements for this product.

However, even without being able to use it, I can tell you several things about it based on what I received.  First of all, it comes iwth a digital copy, which is a great benefit if you want to install it on other compatible devices that do not have a disc drive.  Second, along with the documentation you will receive 10 gb of free Cyberlink Cloud Services good for 1 year, so you can back up your projects and templates.  In addition, you get free online resources via Director Zone, which has free templates for a variety of applications, such as collages, scrapbooks, flyers, calendars, invitations, and more.  The box the product coms in is inspiring, too,; when you open it, you see four full-color pages showing you in a nutshell the kinds of things this product can do.

I hope I can get a new computer soon, and then I will definitely install this, because I'm an amateur photography buff who has been looking for easy-to-use software that does what this product does.  Judging from the other reviews and the thoughtful details evident just from the package, I will love this product.",0
Arrived in several days and worked perfectly in my old Windows 2000 notebook.  Terrific product.  Thanks.,0
"...and all I can base my review on is my own experience with the product. Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

If you're a tax-time procrastinator: April is right around the corner. Now is the time to select with confidence.",0

"I've read the other reviews of this product here, and there are clearly a lot of negatives. Some people find this program too big, some find it too small.
I found it just right.
When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.
Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software.
You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.
I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring.
Now, I have no employees, and I have no interest in eBay, so I sympathize with those who felt that there were more parts to this than they needed. However, I found that this package has just the amount of power I need for keeping track of hours, jobs, clients, income, and expenditure. If I have employees some day, I won't have to learn new software. I can foresee needing to use the banking features, so I'm glad they're there. The extra features don't hamper my use of what I currently need, and I've had the experience before of spending more on trading up than I would have if I'd bought something more powerful to begin with.
I would strongly recommend this package for small businesses.",0

"I wrote in my review of Norton Internet Security 2008 that I used the product - but despised it.  The hit to my system's resources was just too great, and I turned much of it off as a result.

The 2009 version is MUCH faster - to the point where I am leaving all options enabled.  The hit to the system appears to be minimal.  The user interface is simpler and less confusing also.  Big improvements all around.

"Acronis has always worked well as did my old version until I had a hard drive crash and the old version wouldn't recognize a secondary 1TB drive upon re-installing the old version. Sad because other users had complained about this very issue. The current version 2014 (3 license pack) I've only installed on one machine so far with all other machines still using the older version. I also see
Acronis (like so many other software companies) monetizing the concept of one machine per license installation.

Bottom line: if your making major hardware upgrade changes to your computer, expect older versions of Acronis to behave differently than before. Once you purchase this version it will be current with today's existing larger spinning drives, SSD drives, large USB drives.",0

"A lot has been said to denigrate Windows 8.  The ""Metro"" interface doesn't make much sense on a desktop computer without a touchscreen, and the desktop interface that you can switch to doesn't have the all important start button... I think that the person who convince Microsoft to eliminate the ""start button"" was probably an employee planted by Apple.  It was so absolutely stupid to remove the start button that it had to be something like that.

That said, I installed freeware called ""classic start"" that not only gave me the start button back, but also allowed me to configure it so that the system defaults to the desktop configuration when the OS boots.

Aside from the interface, Windows 8 is fast, smooth, flawless... it is a great operating system.  For those purchasing new computers, I recommend you go with Windows 8.  Because Windows 7 is almost as good, stick with that on your older systems.

Microsoft presented us with a very good OS with an interface that doesn't make sense unless you have a touch screen.  Hopefully they'll tweak the interface and return the start button with an update.... are you listening, MIcrosoft?",0

"Please see [...] for a comparison of the features in pre-ribbon versions of Word to WordPerfect.  It is enlightening!

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3. When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel. Based on the $150 difference in price between this version and the student/home version, I would seriously consider the student version.  It is my understanding that it is very similar, if not the same.  The Student/Home version apparently lacks the PDF capabilities of the Standard and Pro versions, so if you need those capabilities, buy this version.  (I would check with with Corel to be certain if all the features are present.)

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal. It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version. It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document. Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7. It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window. This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4. I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use. If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!
One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.
As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

Other Programs:

The Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office. The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning. I haven't yet figured out what Lightning does except act as a notebook of some sort.",0
"The installation of this software went pretty smooth and it automatically downloaded the latest version from the internet through the installation process. I also did a performance benchmark test using PCmark (a standard PC benchmarking program) before and after the installation. There were no noticeable differences in the PCmark score (6206 before the install and 6224 after. The higher the score the better).

I also did a full scan after the installation. It took about 40 mins to scan my test PC which has about 100 GB of data. It found and cleaned 314 items out of 888,000 items scanned. Luckily all of which were tracking cookies.

I would consider keeping this software as a good additional tool for my PC protection.",0
"I've given this five stars not as a review of Windows 8 itself, but of the upgrade product and its installation process.

Basically if you know you want to upgrade to Windows 8, then you can rest assured that this is a good way to do it assuming you're on Windows 7 to begin with.

If you hate Windows 8's guts, then you won't be interested in this to begin with. Personally I have been hoping that 8.1 would resolve the issues, but so far that's sounding like only a partial solution. I can survive in Windows 8, but on a desktop system it's a struggle to get used to the ""tablet style"" user interface that it forces on you each time you want to start a program. Fortunately there are 3rd party addons that will restore the Start button and bypass the Metro UI at startup.

"Of all .ZIP and compressed file decompressing software, WinZip has always been my favorite and remains so. I've never noticed any performance issues created after installing or while using it. It does what it's supposed to do, and I've yet to encounter a file myself that WinZip hasn't been able to handle. I've always enjoyed Corel's products, and yet again they have proven why to me.",0

"There are a lot more features in this software bundle than I realized at first.  My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).

I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.

Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.

Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.

The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.

Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.

Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.

I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.

This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.

All in all, this software has a lot of features for the money, more than I'll probably ever have reason to use.  But it's kept me busy for many hours, most of them enjoyable.  It's not perfect, but I think it's a good deal.",0

"I have been using the Corel PaintShop Pro software since its earliest version and it is still the main photo-editing software I use everyday among other photo-editing software including the PhotoShop. What I like about the Corel PaintShop Pro software are its ease of use and the wealth of features for general quick /easy and the more advanced photo editing.

Here are some of the features I use most often for quick editing :

- smart photo fix : allows a 1-click photo enhancement with real time review and adjustment to our liking
- various photo brushes (clone brush, scratch remover etc) for quick touch-up of the photos
- white balance adjustment for the perfect color balancing
- skin smoothing which makes us look years younger

The software comes with a wealth of advanced features including layering, masking, vector objects, stack filters, raw processing and a variety of photo effects.

This latest version is noticeably faster including the program start-up and the more CPU intensive tasks like skin smoothing and such. It also comes with new features such as magic move which allows us to move an object with an intelligent algorithm to fill the background. There are also bonus CDs including the Perfect Effects, Corel AfterShot, Perfectly Clear SE, and creative collection which enhance our capabilities for photo editing.

For those who are looking a reasonably priced photo editing software with easy-to-use interface and advanced features, this is one to consider.",0
"....Core Duo with 2GB of ram I can run Windows Vista. I am having to allocate 1 GB of ram to get reasonable performance. I do not dedicate both ""cores"" to VM Fusion, but I will caution you that performance on the Mac side will be sluggish on a machine like this while running VMWare.

But, let's think about this. I have a machine that was the cheapest mac sold about 4 years ago. I installed and set up Windows Vista without a single hitch. Everything works out of the box. Consider the complaints you hear about Vista (fair or not). I am running it fine, no problems at all.

The applications I am running are fairly simple. No Solidworks or other 3D software. No games. Just IE, Microsoft office, Camtasia and a few other things. It fills in the gaps for things I need to test out, not owning a ""real PC"".

Should you get this? Do you need to run windows apps with no fuss, and decent performance? Don't want to deal with setting up boot camp, and want both your Mac and ""PC"" available at the same time? Would like like to share folders between machines, and generally not have to mess around with a real PC? How about this -- be able to run pre-made computer OS images so that you can try out stuff like Ubuntu or Drupal without have to install anything? I wanted to test OLPC's Sugar interface, so I found a prebuilt image for VMWare and just ran it -- bingo -- I have a OLCP test machine for web content.

This is well worth owning if you answered yes to any of the questions above.",0

Completely recommended, by a happy customer.",0
"My husband and I love this software.  It is not a resource hog and you don't even notice it's there.  That's what I want in an anti-virus, in addition to having no issues that get through the software.  His Trend Micro expired last month and we decided to just go with the free company that our cable provider offers but quickly regretted that.  It seems to slow down the computer and I actually got some kind of malware with it last year.  The year prior to that my husband had the other big company antivirus and he actually had a ransomware attack. I was so excited to get offered this and we are switching back to the Trend Micro.  It's safe and easy to use.  It doesn't stick a lot of extras on your computer either.  I installed it easily.  You just go to their website, download the software and then put in the code that is mailed to you.  They do not send you a disk. When you get to the download page for this software, you will see different ones for the same - the difference is the 32 bit and 64 bit.  I made the mistake of doing the 32 and it informed me I needed the 64 so I had to change to the correct one.  It all took just a few minutes and I was up and running.  Highly recommend this brand over all the others.",0

"As someone who has used Peachtree for my small business accounting needs for years I always felt that while Peachtree was a good program, it was far too comlicated and bloated for the average small business user.  I wanted something that, quite frankly, made doing my books a snap -- as easy as writing a letter -- and I found it with Microsoft Accounting Professional 2008.

First off, let me state this -- if you are an average user of the Microsoft Office suite of products then Accounting 2008 is going to be a snap for you to use.  They have went to great lengths to make sure you don't need an Accounting degree to understand it.  A lot of the features not only integrate extremely well with Office 2007, but will remind you a lot of using Office (minus the ribbon interface).

One of the really nice features of Accounting is the ability to add third-party add-ins.  Out of the box you get an integration module for Paypal, so your invoices can automatically generate Paypal requests and Accounting can automatically classify and deduct the fees for it from the appropriate accounts.  As your business grows, and you decide that you need to do direct credit card processing, Accounting 2008 lets you integrate with CC processors directly -- again, handling managing the costs and fees for you.

Dashboards are another strong feature of this product.  How is my business doing?  What is my accounts payable looking like?  How much cash do I have on hand?  All that information and more is available through quick, convenient dashboards.  You can drill down into the dashboards to pull up reports to see more detailed data.

If you use Business Contact Manager for Outlook then you are in for a treat -- it integrates directly with Accounting to help you track not only customer information, but also communications and marketing camapaigns!  No more having to hunt and search for emails sent months ago or wondering if your marketing campaigns via e-mail are working.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with the product.  I think it has been a welcome upgrade from Peachtree and thanks to its integration with other products really brings my business into a 360-view.  I know immediately how well things are doing, what my customers are up to, and what needs my attention.

If you own a small business then do yourself a favor and give this a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",0

"I have used TaxCut for at least 10 years.  This year's H&R Block version seems a smooth transition from the last couple years.  I have not done my taxes yet, so I have not encountered any problems.  If I do I will return and update this review.  I did notice in the reviews that some people had troubles in downloading the state edition (VA in my case).  I had no problem downloading and installing the VA program.  Since last year my computer got a virus which required me to erase everything and reload. All my data was backed up on a external drive.  However, I did want to look at my 2008 return on my computer so I reloaded the 2088 TaxCut and updated it with no problem.  Then I downloaded the VA state version for 2008 which went very smoothly.  So far everything is working fine.  Last year I did have a problem with the updates which required me to get tech support from H&R Block which worked very well.

As an aside, I worked for a year as an H&R Block tax preparer and was shocked to learn their program in the office was nothing like TaxCut.  It was very difficult to learn and to use.  Of course, it was very powerful, but a pain.  Even when I worked in the H&R Block office I continued using TaxCut for ours and our children & mother-in-law returns.",0
"I have installed and been using Kapersky 2012 for a while now, and I'm very pleased with this software.  The most important thing, of course, is that this software has protected my computer from viruses.  It's done that admirably.  Beyond the basic protection, there are some features I really like about Kapersky.  This is anti-virus software that runs in the background of your computer.  It doesn't have to do a once-a-day scan like others I've used.  It's always running and always updating.  I've had no problems with Kapersky interfering with anything I'm doing on the computer, whether it be games or other programs.  It doesn't slow down my processing or downloading.  Previously I was using Kapersky 2011, and there are some changes with the 2012 version.  The control panel in the 2012 version is pulled off the task bar and now occupies a corner of the desktop.  It's fairly inconspicuous, though I'd prefer a slightly smaller icon.  It's entirely likely that there's a way to shrink the icon, obviously I'm not bothered enough to look into it.  The control panel is very easy to use, even for someone like me who knows little about computers.  When I bought my new laptop I asked several computer geek friends what anti-virus software they recommended, and they all said Kapersky.  Thus far I'm happy with their recommendations.",0

As a video editing software, it's high quality and supports 4k ultra HD output, as well as 3D features. It also includes seventeen tracks to choose from to add music, as well as a music and speech cleaner. The Pinnacle Studio Ultimate is also more advanced than the Studio and Studio Plus editions, precisely because of its support for blu-rays and 4k ultra HD--which is important for me. Overall, I found this program to be high-quality with a ton of options to choose from.",0

"This is a pretty good piece of software if you're a small company, looking to save some money on legal documents.  Lawyers can cost an arm and a leg (and part of the other arm too) where I live, so this kind of software is a good thing to have.  I wouldn't use this if I were a huge corporation with 1,000 employees, though.

But if you're small, and need some help with things like this, then it's probably right up your alley.  On top of the documents you can prepare, there's also five legal books on the CD as well.  I won't list them all, you can just look at the main product listing for that.

It also has another side benefit - it's not JUST for businesses.  Your home can get some benefit from this as well.

This isn't a substitute for a good attorney, but definitely will get you moving on a number of legal issues cheaply.",0

"Bitdefender works really well on both vista and xp machines, and I really like the clean interface and the fact that it runs pretty low key in the background without excessive popups requiring user responses and it doesn't drag down system resources.  It installs flawlessly, and even will uninstall other antivirus software in case you forgot to do this yourself, which I thought was a really nice touch.  My main criteria for security software is that it needs to run quietly in the background and not hog resources or cause other system issues - which McAfee Antivirus and Norton Internet Security can't seem to figure out how to do.  Before this I used to use Trend Micro PC-Cillen exclusively because it used very little system resource compared to the others, until their latest version which suddenly ballooned into huge resource hog - I don't know if they've fixed that yet or not, I haven't gone back to it since.
  Bitdefender seems to have none of the problems that plague other security software, and I would switch to it exclusively, except on my main PC's I am sticking with Windows Live Onecare, which does the best job of integrating seemlessly into the OS (naturally, since it is Microsoft).
  As far as which is better at stopping viruses and malware, I can't really say, since I am a low risk user and rarely am threatened with viruses and have never accidentally downloaded malware.  I suspect Bitdefender would out perform Windows Live Onecare on this score, which is why I would definitely recommend it to any who doesn't practice safe surfing.
  All in all, it's a very comprehensive security package at a great price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.",0

"CorelDraw's Graphic Suites do the work of several graphic programs (both pixel and vector based) combined, and although they might not be as fancy as Adobe's graphics software when combined with each other and a host of add ons, they give you more than what most people--even graphic professionals like myself--would want at less than half the price. CorelDraw just keeps getting better and better, and this version is the best one yet.

I've been using CorelDraw for years, and for years my fellow digital artists have told me I need to ""upgrade"" to Adobe software. I studied computer graphics on Macs using Adobe programs at a digital-art school, but when I came home I practiced the same things using CorelDraw. There really wasn't much of a difference, except that the Adobe interface was prettier but oddly a little less intuitive.

All my friends pushed me to buy a Mac and get Adobe software. ""It's the only thing artists use,"" they said. ""We just don't use PCs. Macs are designed for creative people, and so is Adobe software.""

""But Adobe programs cost more, and you have to buy several to do the same things as one CorelDraw Suite,"" I replied. ""Some things that come standard in CorelDraw require add-ons in PhotoShop or Freehand, and that means you have to pay even more.""

They pointed out deals for students. I could get Adobe software for about half the retail cost. That made sense for something I needed, but what I already had for less than half the price of one of those programs was already fulfilling my needs. Did I really need to spend that much more to be like everyone else?

I talked to a friend who ran a graphics studio. The artists working under her all worked with Adobe programs ... and she would fix their mistakes in CorelDraw. Then I went to work at a newspaper, where I created illustrations on my PC using scanned images and CorelDraw's Photo-Paint from the CorelDraw Graphics Suite. I exported my images in PNG format, and the layout artist had no problem putting them into pages in the software on his Mac. They looked fine in the newspaper when they were printed.

So while Macs and Adobe might be the industry standard, you won't be left out in the cold if you save your money and choose not to join the crowd.

Two last things:
1. As with all graphics programs, there is a learning curve. However, if you already know one kind well, like PhotoShop, it shouldn't be too hard to adjust to another, like Photo-Paint, which is a part of this suite.

2. CorelDraw tends to try new things with odd numbered releases, so the odd numbered ones tend to be a bit buggier than the even numbered ones. It's usually best to wait for an even numbered suite before you buy.",0

"Corel has come a long way and after using this product for a year, I have to say that it's meets my expectations.

It's a great, affordable alternative to Photoshop, although there are a few areas where it is lacking. Specifically when creating ""silhouette"" images (whiting out the background, blacking out the foreground). This is something that I still have to do in Photoshop, but the biggest +1 is being able to Paste new images without having to open a new image (c'mon, Adobe, you should be past this by now). It makes doing screenshots easy and quick.

I've always enjoyed Corel's shortcut keys and, of course, they haven't changed a bit. I do love the product and I will keep coming back to it. There are some things it just does better than Photoshop, and when worked in tandem, they create excellent images!",0

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I am a first-time Painter user, using Painter 11 as my first version of the tool, and my background prior to using Painter 11 is mainly as a serious amateur photographer using both Photoshop and Corel's own Photo-Paint.  This is a very powerful and creative software for both graphic artists and photographers.  I found the learning curve to be fairly steep, but a large part of my learning progress was sped up when I also ordered the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Painter-11-for-Photographers-Creating-painterly-images-step-by-step/dp/0240521234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Painter 11 for Photographers: Creating painterly images step by step</a>&nbsp;, which I highly recommend as a book/DVD accompaniment to Painter 11 if, like me, you are new to this kind of graphics transformation software.  For achieving various effects when combined with digital photography, I find that I often do not even use Photoshop in my workflow now.  I would tend to give the ergonomics and usability of the software 3.5 to 4.0 stars, but the power and features that are packed into this fun application are so good that this is worth 5 stars!",0

The price to usefulness/quality ratio of this Poe is definitely worth it. I had it in use for a SOLID THREE YEARS without even a hiccup. I had a headset w/mic that I used for work, on a daily basis, and this item was a charm and one of the best small investments I made; Once connected I never gave it a second thought. The only reason it's not in use any longer is I no longer have the device I used it with. However, I know when I get another device that can utilize Poe, this little baby will come off the shelf.

Years ago I owed what I think was the first version of this product and it didn't work very well.  This product however works really well.  The menus are a bit confusing but as far as tracking goes this is a good product.  I  used it while on a trip along side my Magellean GPS and it compared well.  The PC version is a little slower than the standalone GPS but it is a nice alternative to buying a more expensive GPS.  Another pro is you have a bigger view of the map and can zoom in and out.,0
"This Vehicle Tracker from AwareGPS is a fantastic tool for parents of new or inexperienced drivers, as well as for businesses who want to keep track of fleet vehicles.

It's about as simple as it gets. Install the free AwareGPS app on your smartphone, set up your account and then plug the small device into the OBD port on your car (generally located underneath the dash below and to the left of the steering wheel. The port is keyed so it can only plug in one way.) That's it. The device instantly sends info to your smart phone concerning where the car has driven and at what time, whether or not the driver was speeding and by how many miles over the limit, how much gas is in the tank, whether the battery is functioning properly, if the device has been removed, etc. You can also follow your car's movements real time.

This is brilliant! Not only does it let you, the parent and car owner, keep tabs on your car, it lets the driver see his/her ""report card"" and helps them become better drivers (hopefully.) It would also be excellent for when deadbeat relatives want to borrow your car ""to run to the convenience store""...

It would make it very simple to track a car that has been stolen, too. This is something I really like since I live in a large city and actually had my car stolen some years ago. I hope I never need it for this purpose but I'm glad it's there.

The service costs $19.99/mo and you can start and stop service as needed with no penalties because there is no contract.

My youngest child will be driving next year and I already feel a sense of relief knowing I have this. I just wish I'd had it when my other children were new drivers.",0
"OK here is the deal...  I got this 2 in 1 i5core/ 6GB/ 1TB hard drive machine on Christmas eve 2015 and it was unbelievably slow.

"The new WinZip has been upgraded with a variety of useful features. Installation was quick and easy. WinZip has been the consumer standard for compression, and they have branched out and separated the software into various editions including a Courier for email, a self extractor, utilities malware protection and so on. This review covers the standard edition, WinZip 17. This standard has a lot of great new features that make it more useful than ever. WinZip can now convert doc, docx (Word files), xls, xlsx (Excel files) and ppt, pptx (PowerPoint files) by selecting the Convert to PDF box in the Create tab and simply dragging your document into the work area. That alone is fantastic. By selecting options beforehand, you can encrypt your files (Winzip wipes and deletes any temporary files so they cannot be recovered, great protection option). You can right click and create zip files straight from Windows Explorer, sort columns by clicking on headers, processes files such as RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ,TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, LHA, CAB, UUencode, BinHex & MIME files. There are even iOS & Android apps for Apple & Google devices. You can resize images (great for compressing large photos). You can even add Watermarks to your Files with the extensions of BMP, GIF, JPG, PDF, PNG and TIF. The toolbars are very easy to use and are context sensitive, adapting to the task you are working on. Another great new feature is sharing with your social media accounts. You can post any type of file to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn with ZipShare. You can also send large files up to 2GB from your email account with ZipSend.  For me the best new feature is the access to cloud files. WinZip will connect to Dropbox, SkyDrive, Box and Google Drive. You can save a ton of space by zipping files to your cloud accounts or extracting to them. File compression can be customized to your specifications and is quick and fast. I love being able to convert documents to quick PDFs (no it doesn't have the features of Acrobat or Create PDF, but it gets the job done if you need an Office document converted to share or send). The Cloud integration is excellent. Just link WinZip to the service or services you use and you can zip or extract to them in a few minutes. WinZip makes the setup for this a breeze. This is particularly good for large size files or photos since extra space costs $$. I have used WinZip before and this new edition is the best ever. While many complain about the cost, WinZip is really an excellent product. I have tried several other compression programs like 7Zip (shareware) and Power Archiver. 7Zip for me is a great hassle. We have it at work and it is useless because even though it is installed on some machines, co-workers have a difficult time opening files so I never use it. When we had WinZip, everything ran smoothly. It may not be the most advanced compression option, the Pro Version has more advanced features, but it is certainly the easiest to use and the new features make it worth it. Connection  to the Cloud drives and quick PDF conversion are the features I use most often and it is fast and easy. There is also plenty of help available if needed and you can right click for more options. I highly recommend WinZip 17, Corel has stepped up their game for usefulness. A new must have.",0
"""Still the most beautiful and elegant OS out there bar none. Just looking at beautiful box Snow Leopard comes in you already know you won't be disappointed since the attention to all the little details is there. The check out clerk took his time admiring it and commenting on it's beauty before leaving BestBuy too LOL. I'm serious I've never had a checkout clerk actually take time to admire a products packaging before! I also got it for $5 cheaper at BestBuy than buying it direct from Apple. Anyways, when I got it home I installed it on my 2009 macmini and the upgrade when as smooth as butter. It freed up all kinds of diskspace as everyone has been mentioning and everything was noticeably snappier right away. Even the startup and boot times were faster if you can believe that! Also, I was happy to see that my Bootcamp install of Windows still worked and ran fine after the upgrade.
I have yet to run into any compatibilty problems with any of my apps or hardware so that is another plus.
Only thing I could really complain about is lack of powerpc hardware support but then again if you have a powerpc like my old mac it's probably like 10 years old and no OS upgrade is going to help much LOL.
You can still run older powerpc programs though and the first time you try to run them you'll get a popup saying you need Rosetta and it'll automatically be installed. I don't know why it's not just installed by default but then again that's probably how Apple got a clean install of Snow Leopard to be so lean and take up so little space by getting rid of the old stuff.
Also, if you boot from the dvd and do try to do a clean install Apple has dumbed down the installer so much that everything is automatic and there is no erase, archive,etc options like in Leopard so you have to manually open up the disc utility from the menu and format if you want a clean install. Finally, Apple changed the way disc space is calculated. Snow Leopard calculates disk space using base 10 measurement now instead of the old base 2 way. So you'll actually see a 500GB hard drive report it's size as 500GB in finder instead of 465GB.

This is definitely and OS for the future so, unless you have a program that you know does work with 10.6, this upgrade is a no-brainer especially at the low price compared to other products like Win7.""",0

"I have been using SM for nearly 5 years now. I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

Highly recommended!",0
"It's been a number of years since I used WordPerfect, because my first word processor program was Microsoft Word, version 1.0.

I think my favorite version of Word was 3.0, which was the version that finally convinced my employer to ditch WordPerfect and go Microsoft for everything.

During the last several years, however, Microsoft has been changing course. Their operating system has altered, but, worse yet, Office has become very difficult to use for me and, alas, has persuaded me to try WordPerfect. Result?

I love it. After Shot is a nice benefit, but it is the seamless ease of use that is much more intuitive than Word that wins me over. I intend to spend a great deal of time learning the key sequences that will enable me to become more professional in producing my handbooks and procedures at work, and in writing my reviews for Amazon.

I'll not bore you with a detailed review, for I see several excellent reviews already posted. Just take my word for it, WordPerfect makes document preparation, er, writing, fun again.

"I've reviewed iWork in the past, and have always thought it was well worth the $79 asking price.  However, with iWork '08, these applications have become MUCH more valuable to me.

Some context: I am a marketing executive by day, and an independent writer by night.  During working hours, I use Pages to create whitepapers, sell sheets, and other items that we used to have to outsource to a designer for a few $K each.  Pages makes documents look so professional, we've been able to take most of this work in house.  In fact - I do it myself, and it takes less of my day to do it myself than it would take for me to manage the outsourced help.  ages is just easy to use, and creates fantastic looking documents.

I use Keynote when I give presentations myself, but use Powerpoint normally (because no one else has Keynote, and I don't want to have to keep converting files).  Keynote opens powerpoints fine, so I can watch/present a presentation without having to have Parallels open.  It exports well to powerpoint, too, so I can work in Keynote exclusively if I want to: for example, when working on a plane and tryin to conserve battery life by NOT running windows side-by-side with OS X.

Similarly, spreadsheets open fine - but I'm a marketing guy, so I may not be the best judge of number-stuff.

For my alter-ego as a wannabe writer, I use iWork even more.  I wrote, edited, designed and produced by newest novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>) entirely using Pages '08.  For anyone who has written a book, this means not only writing 100,000+ words, but it also means re-write upon re-write.  I tracked nearly thrity minor drafts of my manuscript through the life of the project.  Some points about Pages:

1. It handled the large files easily.  Scrolling through 300+ pages was fluid on a MacBook Pro.  Even when the illustrations were put in place (27 individual 400dpi images) the file remained easy to manipulate.
2. The spelling  & grammar checks work better than expected.  Of course, you can't rely on these, but they are a necessary aide when dealing with massive amounts of text.  The 'proofread' function was markedly better than MS Word's grammar check, although I missed an ""ignore this rule"" button.
3. Searching for certain words seemed to miss results on occasion, especially when the text was formatted specially or the search term contained punctuation (I submitted this as a bug to Apple, and it will likely be resolved in a future revision)
4. Pages was able to create a print-ready .pdf easily without requiring any extra software.  The high-resolution of the images was preserved (I worried about this, since the app handled them so easily in-line I figured maybe they' been downsampled), ad all formatting remained intact.
5. Sepaking of formatting: I was able to design the interior block of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>&nbsp;with absolute precision, and I was also able to adjust the design along the way with little effort.

The bottom line is that Pages '08 is even better at producing quality, professional-looking and print-ready documents than the original Pages.  Cluck is ""searchable inside"" (or will be, soon) so you can see for yourself how Pages can produce results.

Keynote
I also use Keynote for personal uses other than corporate presentations.  Interestingly enough, Keynote '08 has been critical to me in the development of promotional videos for my book.  Now, I'm no move director, but with Keynote I can:

* animate objects along a path
* chose from a variety of quality transitions
* imbed movie files (AVI files from my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flip-Video-Camcorder-60-Minutes-Black/dp/B000ONDRFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flip Video Camcorder: 60-Minutes (Black)</a>&nbsp;)
* add text (again, with great font handling)
* control the timing of everything
* export to .mov videos

I was able to create some great-looking (well, I am an amateur, but I think they look great) videos, with hardly ay effort (and about 30 minutes, tops).  If you want to see for yourself, you can find them on YouTube is you search around for ""cluck"" and/or ""book promo"".

Overall, I would recommend iWork '08 to anyone who needs professional results but isn't professionally trained ad/or who lacks the serious $$$ required to purchase more ""professional"" tools. The applications are easy to use, well-integrated with the ""Mac experience"", and produce amazing results.  All for small change.

In the business world, iWork has what it takes to bring smaller projects in-house, which could save huge amounts of budget money AND save time.

I would give this ten stars if I could.",0
"For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 (Family Edition) is bargain priced.  First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.

I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 - for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.

I'm permitted to update this review, and I will if I experience any problems.  Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy.

12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.  After the install and update, I ran a full scan and found a missed virus on one computer, a network threat and a privacy threat on a second computer.  This is not good, but it could be worse.  Neither the virus or the other missed threats caused me any harm.  And Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 is an incredable improvement over anything they have ever produced - possibly better than anything on store shelves.

If I could I would change this review rating to 4 stars.",0
"I am a long time user of Photoshop Lightroom, from the first version. I used to use Photoshop to manage and edit digital images, but switched to LR totally from then. LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.

Well, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.

If you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video. But if you want more like publishing, converting and optimizing images, I recommend this training video.",0

"This product was made exclusively for the Mac from the ground up, but with its slick black glossy interface palettes it looks like it is running on Vista.
Aside from that, this program is great! For those who think IPhoto is severely limited and don't want to spend what you need to spend for Photoshop, Pixelmator is a great alternative at such a low cost. For those who are familiar with the photoshop interface, you might find the one in Pixelmator eerily similar. You will notice the tools palette on the left and the layers on the right. I am an artist by no means, but I enjoy manipulating my photos with this program with ease. It has over 130 filters which you can see the results in real time before applying, great color correction tools, and it exports in a large variety of formats. You can even take a picture using your Isight camera and add it as a layer in your picture.

Like I said before, I am no artist, and this program is great for the average to advanced user who does not need everything that Photoshop has to offer. You can tell that the makers of this program did their homework and took full advantage of the best features of Photoshop and included here int his program at such a moderate price. For those who decide to eventually get Photoshop, Pixelmator is a great tutorial to practice on. Though the way some of the tools operate differ somewhat from photoshop such as the magic wand and the rubber band like tool used to adjust some of the filters the overall effect is the same and top notch.

I think this program is well worth the money, and hey you can try it before you buy it at the Pixelmator website, so don't take my word for it, try it yourself!",0
"As a professional photographer and graphic artist I use several photo editing apps on a daily basis. I could offer no more important suggestion to anyone considering this app (or any other app) than, if you are serious about changing your snapshots into works of art, to own and use at least 2-3 different photo editing apps.

Where does this one fit in? Well, it's not PhotoShop which for most people is a good thing. PhotoShop can be daunting to learn and a challenge to use. Unfortunately at the other end of the scale are a lot of apps that are just as hard to use but can make a mess of your photos.

Personally, in addition to PhotoShop, for my professional and also for my own fun time I use Digital Image Pro, PhotoBrush, PhotoScape, Corel PaintShop and Painter and a few special effects apps, and now PhotoDirector.

What works for me may not be the same thing that works for you so I won't reiterate every individual spec of this app but will call out some of the more important things that can help you decide if you should purchase it:

1. It does a LOT for the price, so it almost becomes a no-brainer to pop $50 for such a powerful app.

2. It features non-destructive file saving ... a fancy way of saying it makes a copy of your original so you can play to your heart's content without messing up your original photo

3. The default presets are fantabulous. You can click through each of them until you find the one that suddenly makes your snapshot look like it was taken by Ansel Adams.

4. The tool to remove an element from a photo works better than the one I have used for years, and I use such a tool almost every day. No matter how well you plan a photo there is always something in the frame that distracts the eye, PhotoDirector makes it easy to remove it like it was never there.

5. The slideshow function is worth the price all by itself, easy to use and extremely professional.

What's not to like? I would have preferred that the top, bottom and side menus be a bit slimmer, they leave too small of an area for the actual photo you're working on if you're using a 22"", 23"" or 24"" monitor.

I have a bookshelf full of photo editing apps that I have evaluated and never used again. This one is a keeper and from a person who makes a living in photography I recommend it.",0
"Norton = absolutely reliable.

As a longtime Mac user, Norton has always been my most reliable source for internet security and for utilities.  Even though Macs have generally been free from any kind of malware - unless you do something to get it--it is still good to be able to scan and check for mistakes.  Because of my work and research, I sometimes have to use a PC to work.  As my PC does relatively little else than scan and follow research databases and log into my secure work site, imagine my surprise when Norton identified 430 errors, only 429 of which were fixable.

I've been trying to track down that last one to no avail.

This software was very easy to install- just insert the CD and click through a few times.  It offers convenient features, like the scheduling the time for virus scans and updates.  What's possibly most impressive to me is that it provides good security protection without messing up any of the other applications I use online, as some anti-virus programs do.  Overall, I see myself sticking with BitDefender for anti-virus software in the future.",0
Much better than 2011 version,0
I have used Quicken forever. I consider it to be one or the most essential pieces of software that I own. I use it daily and rely on it to look up many older purchases that I can't remember when or how much I paid for. Tax time it is very handy in bringing all the expenses together. It is the best tool for budgeting. I would be lost without it.,0
"Been a user of streets since it first came out a long time ago.  I love the program so looked forward to this update.  I never had the GPS unit previously, so I enjoyed the GPS it really caught a signal quickly and accurately tracked.  It's a pity that streets and trips has lost much of its lustre over the years with standalone GPSs now so affordable and online mapping sources having taken over.  But still, I love streets because I can quickly map and get detailed stuff printed without ads in the way or getting confused.  Scrolling is super duper fast since it's all native to your PC, no remote caching is done.",0
"What a great program!  PhotoPlus X4 is perfect for people that want to manipulate their photography, but don't have big bucks for the other professional programs. PhotoPlus allows you to edit with automatic layers so you don't have to worry about ruining your original, as well as fix red eye and picture blemishes.

One of my favorite features in this program is the fact that you can change the saturation of separate colors quite easily.  I've never used a program that could separate colors out like that before and think it's quite cool!  Also it seems like the effects are really well done.  The black and white conversion of color pictures looks really nice.

There's a vast number of tools and most of them are self explanatory when editing basic photography.  The animation portion of this is a bit of a mystery to me still, as I'm not sure how to use it yet.  That being said, I also don't need to use that portion for much other than playing around.  The photography tools are pretty easy to understand if you've ever used other editing programs.  If you are new to the whole world of digital photo editing, it may take you a bit to catch on, but if you play with the features, you'll eventually get it.

Overall, this program is definitely something amateur photographers (aka photographers on a budget) should consider getting.  It is one of the best budget programs I've seen.",0
"Power Director Ultimate does a wonderful job helping you edit your videos.  By going to Directorzone.com, you can also view training videos to help you get started if you are new to using the software.  Plus, there are thousands of other users who post free templates and provide up-to-date advice to help almost anyone improve.  This online community is very helpful for beginners and advanced users.

As with any software, there is a learning curve but you have access to a lot of free training.  With PD13 Ultimate, they have also included a year of free 10GB storage in the cloud (you will have to pay after the year) to at least give you somewhere to put your videos temporarily.  PD13 Ultimate does not include AudioDirector 5 or ColorDirector 3 (you can get both of these with the Ultimate Suite).

With all of the included templates and quality effects (over 500) your creativity will be stimulated.  If you take the time to work with the program, you will find it fast and powerful.  Highly recommended!",0
I bought an hp laptop from a local retailer a month ago and the computer came pre-installed with a 60 day trail of norton. I've always used their products so I knew that I would be getting this new version of norton soon. I had 29 days left on the trail version when I bought the full version. Very easy to install and didn't take long at all and it dosen't slow my computer down at all. HP computers work better with norton.,0

"In the beginning there were not many choices in computer virus protection, but that changed throughout the years and the market is now flooded to the point where the general consumer does not know what to purchase.

Enter McAfee -- one of the first virus protections on the market and arguably still the best.

To test out McAfee Internet Security 2009. I knowingly infected a test machine with a minor trojan virus. I then went ahead and and installed a free virus cleaner that did not detect it. I then went ahead and installed McAfee which picked it up right away and cleaned it up.

McAfee has been a name synonymous with quality for quite some time now, and in 2009 it does it again. CPU and processor speed does not spike as with some virus software and you will know your computer is safe ans sound.",0

All have been recognized and the space expanded without a hitch. I highly recommend this product.,0
"I have a child with autism who is developmentally delayed in many areas. He has come very far and is now a great reader, though I had wished I had something like this for him years ago. I tried many reading programs, including Hooked on Phonics and those learning websites like Reading Eggs and ABC Mouse, but none really got him motivated enough to make a big difference. Now with my 5-year-old that just started kindergarten, I am hoping to get off to an early start and put this to use with her. I love that it works on iPad because every child I know is very familiar with them and knows how to operate them with ease. Not so much with a computer. Typing and using a mouse was a big obstacle, not to mention having to sit at a desk, especially for a child that can't sit still for very long. Being able to do all this on a portable iPad is worth it's weight in gold.

I've previewed the program before starting out with the kids, and I love what I see. Everything is very animated and colorful and it makes the entire process truly entertaining. The little ""Lingos"" are very cute and add a lot to the lessons. The way the skills transition is also very smooth and well thought out. It starts with the basics, names of letters and letter sounds, and then starts building from there, putting sounds together two at a time, and eventually putting them into full words. I've always been a fan of LeapFrog products for learning to read, but since most households have an iPad of some sort these days, I'd say it's worth it to purchase this for your existing tech over going out and buying a children's tablet and it's associated software which will easily cost much more in the long term than just buying this set.

Overall, I think it's a fantastic value and should be on every parent's list for little ones about to start school or just starting as well as for those who are struggling. It will give them a huge leg up. With public school curriculum getting more and more challenging all the time, kids are expected to be reading fluently in first grade and there's not much opportunity for catch up as the reading skill is required for all other subjects. The packaging is adorable too, with a cute little ribbon handle, so it would make a really nice gift for any child. Great product all around.",0

"OK here is the deal...  I got this 2 in 1 i5core/ 6GB/ 1TB hard drive machine on Christmas eve 2015 and it was unbelievably slow. I had to wait about 15 seconds to see a row of my pictures, downloads took extremely long, YouTube videos buffered at lease 10 times in one minute, updates kept popping up every time I turned this machine on. I began looking into replacing my NEW hard drive with a newer SSD hard drive and I was getting extremely stressed and pissed off. I mean, my girlfriends 5 yrs old $300 HP laptop was faster, so I called Asus tech support 1-888-678-3688. They talked me through a hard reboot and, ""OMG!"" This is the fastest computer ever! I don't know if it needed a factory update or what, but it is really fast. I can go on Netflix, YouTube, listen to music, watch picture, and surface yahoo news, with no buffering or delays.",0
"If you know Painter, there's not much I can add about the program in general.  There's nothing else like it. It's an art studio in a box, on your computer. Allowing an almost infinite creativity to take shape.  It's the sort of program where the key learning task isn't the software itself, it's learning how to draw, or paint, or design.  Useful for sketching, for composing, for testing out ideas, for putting together test pieces. Allows you to discover new processes and try new mediums. No, of course it's not an exact replica of real painting or drawing. But it is as close as a computer can get, mimicking the textures and attributes of a very wide array of mediums.

If you don't know Painter, get to know it if you are a serious artist who wants to expand to computer based approaches.  Or if you're a budding artist.  It definitely helps to have an Intuous pad of one kind or another, but this isn't absolutely essential (well, maybe it is in a way...)

I've owned previous versions. If you own the most recent version, there's not really a big reason to upgrade. The perspective lines are quite helpful and there are improvements across the board, but nothing so substantial to justifying paying a lot of money. Of course, if you're a teacher or student you can get this for a big discount, just look up the academic version.

I loaded this on my Dell 15R touchscreen laptop and am happy to say it works great with the touchscreen. Very responsive.  The screen itself is not anything near as sensitive an Intuos, but it definitely works quite well.

No downsides or glitches or negatives that I've seen here. Runs smoothly, runs great even on a far from top of the line computer.  Corel makes great software that works and works without the constant nagging that Adobe insists on.",0
"This is a really great program. The best feature is the chromecast/Roku streaming. I had much more issues with chrome browser-based casting than this casting service, plus I can use Roku by itself if I want and leave the buggy chromecast out of it altogether. The software also provides the ability to play DVDs and Blu-rays in my disc drive, which is surprisingly not an included feature with my computer. There are other features as well but those are the only ones I tried. The only complaint I have is the price; it does seem a little pricey. Overall, great software.",0
Operates good as always.,0
"I was previously using Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.0 and am surprised at the noticeable difference in the upgrade to 13.0.
The first noticeable difference is my only real criticism - this version took far longer to download than my previous version (and is something other reviewers have noted so apparently it was not an isolated experience).
But once installed, everything runs smoothly and seamlessly.
Included with the software is a high-quality headset but I find myself using my laptop's internal mic instead. This is an area that especially surprised me - the accuracy even without a headset is impressive, thereby saving me the hassle of always traveling with a separate mic.
So far, I have used this in Word, Publisher and for web surfing all with good results. Because I work in media publishing, I am used to triple checking everything so any occasional inaccuracy doesn't bother me - I like having that necessary ""last step"" to check spelling, content and formatting. Even so, this is a huge time saver.
Also,transcriptions from an audio file/voice recorder were close to error-free.
I have had slightly less success using this for web browsing, which I attribute to user error since this is a new function for me.
I doubt many people will routinely use all of the many features found in Naturally Speaking Premium 13.0  but the ones you do rely on are easily mastered and will give most everyone more than satisfactory results.
Whether you are a newcomer or seasoned user of Dragon Naturally Speaking, Premium 13.0 is worth consideration if you are looking to streamline your productivity.",0

"I'll admit, I've been running Windows 7 for six months now: the preproduction version of it and have just upgraded to the gold code.  So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system.  Let's get to the nitty gritty:

Should you upgrade from Windows Vista?  YES!  I mean it - upgrade today.
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.  Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2.

Should you upgrade from Windows XP? Maybe, but for different reasons.
XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good.  However, XP is old as an operating system.  Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7.  That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system.

64 bit or 32 bit?
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section.  If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better.  If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now.

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
I recommend you have:
-a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine
-4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market)
-good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50)
-back up your files to a USB drive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-My-Passport-Essential-500-GB-USB-2-0-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-WDME5000TN-Midnight-Black/dp/B001F9LY14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black)</a>
-check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7

INSTALLATION:
Installation was very straight forward.  You put in the CD and reboot your machine.  You might have to enter your bios and enable the ""boot from CD"" option.  Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation.  You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation.  I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system.  It worked great.
The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider.
I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should  help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition.  I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front.  That said, I recently upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-CP2025DN-Color-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B001F0RI1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer</a>&nbsp;that I love so no real loss there.  I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print.  Everything else upgraded.

BENEFITS
-faster boot time
-faster go to sleep
-faster wakeup
-faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond)
-joining wireless networks is much easier
-the interface is just plain beautiful
-my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture)
-Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop.  I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me
-Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running
-Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data.  It's great!  I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files!
-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love.
-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-3User-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010</a>. Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but

CONS:
- Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver.
- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS.

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET?
I got the ultimate version because I have clients who ask, ""is your hard drive encrypted?"" -- I wanted to be able to say yes and have sensitive data encrypted one of my computer volumes - Bitlocker is only available in the Ultimate version.  Ultimate also includes Multilanguage support.

If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition.  If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining.  Also Windows Professional gives you the option to run applications in XP mode so if you have old applications you can use that nifty feature.  I already have 1 application running in XP mode - it's nifty to run an old application.

NOTE:
The box contains both the 32 bit and 64 bit OS.

OVERALL:
It's very hard to write a comprehensive review on an entire operating system so I didn't even try - I'm sure magazines will devote entire articles to the operating system and several books will come out.  My goal here is just to give everyone a glimpse of what I've found to date with this new OS. I do hope this has helped you in making a decision.

Hats off to Microsoft on Windows 7.  It's more of a refined Windows Vista than an entirely new operating system but it was needed.  Thank you.",0

"For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I'm looking for three things:

1. Easy to install and easy to use

2. Operates light and doesn't slow down my laptop

3. The software works.

Trend Micro met all three of those expectations, so much so that I bought the full Trend Micro Internet Security Pro package for three users. After years of frustration with McAfee and Norton - software incompatibility and system resources bogged down - I am pleased with the Trend Micro experience.

I've also switched from IE to Firefox, which eliminated the frozen screens and slow Internet surfing. I recommend Trend Micro and Firefox, especially if you spend a lot of playing and shopping on the Internet.",0

The graphics are clear and do not have high hardware requirements. The music is well chosen and appropriate. And the gameplay you will find yourself longing for after some hours away from the game.

"I am running a Intel Celeron 1.0 Ghz custom built PC which only has USB 1.0 built on the motherboard.
Recently, I bought a less expensive USB 2.0 card at a local retailer thinking a usb card is a usb card.  I had a horrible time installing it and it never really worked right.  When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller.
That is when I searched the net and looked at reviews for the best USB 2.0 card out right now.  Every computer magazine website gave this card excellent reviews so I thought I would buy it from Amazon.com and give it a try.
It was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.  Since I have an older machine I did not have any front usb ports. With this in mind along with the great reviews it has been given the purchase was a no brainer. I believe the NEC drivers which this card uses makes it top notch.  I would recommend this card highly.",0

"There are a lot more features in this software bundle than I realized at first.  My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).

I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.

Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.

Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.

The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.

Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.

Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.

I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.

This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.

All in all, this software has a lot of features for the money, more than I'll probably ever have reason to use.  But it's kept me busy for many hours, most of them enjoyable.  It's not perfect, but I think it's a good deal.",0
"Nancy Drew's 13th game finds her full steam ahead in pursuit of the ghostly legend of Jake Hurley. Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The ""ghost train"" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.

The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.

There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the ""make your own sandwich"" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.

Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it. A wonderful addition to a groundbreaking line of girls' software, ""Blue Moon Canyon"" is sure to delight.",0
"Now I have written many reviews on all kinds of different security software. If you've read some of them you may recall that Trend micro (which I had previously used for about 5 years) isn't one of my favorites any longer due to how much space it requires on your hard drive as opposed to other brands & being slower BUT all in all, it still works pretty good.
Now the advantage of having Trend Micro on a USB drive is that not only can you use it on different computers BUT now it will not take up any valuable space on your hard drive. That is especially nice for netbooks which are extremely limited in hard drive space. Now like I said previously, it does work fine but it really isn't as fast as other competitors like Kapersky & Vipre, but then again you have to install them to your computer. So, Trend Micro does protect you from viruses & in this format, on a USB drive, it saves valuable space on your hard drive IF that is a concern for you (like my son who has a netbook) this is a pretty good deal but......... there are faster security programs out there IF space is not a factor!",0
"I think I have about every version of PowerDVD ever produced.  The only version that ever gave me a problem was Version 12. I installed it on my Windows 8 based HP desktop computer and it would crash the operating system each and every time after I installed it.  I installed and uninstalled it about three times before I finally gave up. However, Version 13 installs and plays DVDs on the same Windows 8 HP computer without any issue.  So for at least my particular Windows 8 desktop computer, they fixed whatever the problem was with Version 12. PowerDVD claims their TrueTheater enhancements mean a sharper picture, enhanced lighting, and smoother motion - even on HD content. I use PowerDVD and my desktop computer instead of a dedicated Blu-ray player so that I can watch steaming movies on Netflix or archived movies on my bank of hard drives. I play everything through my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-STR-DA2400ES-7-1-Channel-Home-Theater-AV-Receiver/dp/B001CSCCGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony STR-DA2400ES 7.1 Channel Home Theater AV Receiver</a>&nbsp;for up-conversion and I can't detect much - if any - difference between a Blu-ray movie or a regular DVD on my Panasonic 65 inch plasma HDTV.

Cyberlink seems to come out with a new version of PowerDVD quite frequently. For my needs, all versions do about the same thing - play DVD movies on my computer. If you already own PowerDVD, I'm not sure it is financially worth it to upgrade unless there is some particular feature you can't live without.  But if you don't have any DVD playing software, then I most assuredly recommend that you purchase PowerDVD 13. I've tried the cheaper DVD player software, but they all fall way short of PowerDVD. I believe this newest version of PowerDVD will serve your needs well into the future.",0
"I used this to upgrade my desktop from Windows XP.  I could not upgrade my system through the upgrade option.  I had to do a custom install, which deleted all my files and software.  I had to reinstall all my software, which was fine with me and I had already saved all my important files, so it was not too much trouble.  I had to call Microsoft to complete the upgrade and found the tech. support to be very helpful.  I still cannot use my sound card properly, but was told that may happen, so I was not surprised.  I really like the Vista over the XP, which is only a personal preference.  If I had known I would have to do the custom install ahead of time I would have just went ahead and bought the full version instead of the upgrade version, but over all I am pleased with the product and would recommend it.",0

"Ive used Turbo Tax for the 3 previous years & will use it this year as well. I don't have alot of deductions, or any children & Im single but I 'aint' the sharpest knife in the drawer & Im kinda math stupid. So in the past Ive always be a little apprehensive when I mail my returns.

I also moved 3 years ago from a state with no state taxes to a state that does collect taxes. Alot of taxes! That along with the fact that Im making more money (curse this G.W.Bush economy!) & have a larger 401K, a substantial high interest savings account & a another investment on the side, I feel the need to get the most I can out of my taxes & reporting of same.

My taxes are fairly straight forward ( I think!? ) & with some effort I could go back to doing them again. But I have made mistakes doing my taxes  in the past & Turbo Tax ( so far ) has not. I feel confidant using Turbo Tax & that alone is worth the price of admission.

As far as the e filing, I don't use it. Thankfully, Im in a position where I can wait for my check. If I got it right away it wouldnt make any difference in my quality of life so the expense is just a waste for me.

Also, I didn't read it here but while at Staples last night I saw something about getting a free year of credit monitoring from Experian when you purchase the deluxe model. NOW, how much would you pay!? ;P",0

"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",0
Excellent TAX software that I use every year.,0
"In the past I got a new PC and it came with a few weeks free of McAfee AntiVirus Plus at a discount price.  I am a Norton guy on all my personal PCs.  Most of my work environments in the past have been McAfee because it is cheaper.  It was dog slow in the past, but I figured they would have got it right by now.  WRONG.  I was constantly turning off the active scan to speed up compiling and transferring files.

The product touted - This version of McAfee Internet Security was developed specifically to work with your Dell PC for maximum security, speed and seamless operation.

What a load of crap that turned out to be.  After my third virus, the happily re-director being the last, I uninstalled McAfee, Bought and downloaded Norton.  Virus gone and PC is running fast again.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I GET SUCKERED INTO McAfee!!!

I tried Microsoft's free Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software, but I ran into performance problems.  It made the system hang while it updated.

Norton runs light on the system (it is not a resource hog) and has always come through when my boxes come under attack. The price for 10 licenses can't be beat.

Norton is easy to install and configure. The help docs are great. I had to punch a hole in the firewall to remote to my server from my iPhone and had it done in 2 minutes.
Buying this software could save you hours of headaches trying to get your infected box back.

I have had to wipeout friend's hard drives because their systems were so infected.

I am not using the Mac or iPhone products.  I am using it on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1

"I've spent years writing in Word.  I've tried other programs for writers but until Scrivener came along, there was nothing that really worked the way I needed it to.  I needed to make notes, I needed to keep reference photos, I needed to have separate folders for the story itself, and all the bits and pieces of information I'd collected about it.  I needed a place to keep templates for character development and other aspects of the story.  In short, I needed a place where I could keep my story, story bible, and all my resources in one place so that I could click back and forth between them in one program rather than hopping around from one program to another.  Scrivener is that program.

I've begun to think of Scrivener as Photoshop for writers.  You can do good work in it without even scratching the surface of what it can do.  Honestly, I discover new functions in it all the time.  I only recently discovered how to make comments on my text!  The point here is that you need to keep at it.  Do the tutorial, poke around in it and see what it does.  Yes, there's a learning curve, but there is for virtually any stand-alone word processor worth using, too, and Scrivener does so much more than a word processor will.

I was lucky enough to be able to take advantage of a half-price offer given to NaNoWriMo winners, but I can tell you that now that I've used it for close to a year, I would happily pay full price for this program and still feel I got a bargain.",0
"The ninth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. This is my favorite game, so I'm gonna go nuts here. Things are graded A-F, just like school.

The Crime: A +

Nancy tries to take another vacation, this time by spending some time on Katie Firestone's whale watching boat in Snake Horse Harbor. The minute she arrives, plans change! Katie's boat has been vandalized. An orphan orca has shown up in the bay and there are different opinions as to what to do with it. Did Katie's big mouth get her in trouble?

Suspects include fisherman Holt Scotto, cafe-owner Jenna Devlin, and rival whale watching tourguide Andy Jason.

I'd never had a chance to learn anything about whales or the ocean and thought this was an endlessly cool premise.

Puzzles: A +

Nancy has to figure out everything from nautical terms to knots to Morse code. People give her tasks and quizzes. It can be as easy as making a sandwich or as hard as traveling underground tunnels and counting rocks.

Gameplay: A +

This game has it all. You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.

The only thing missing is maybe romance. But you get to talk to Frank and Joe Hardy on the phone, so that's close enough. (I love those boys.)

Time Changes: None.

Voice Acting: A +

In a word, perfect.

Favorites -

""Ah. Nuts."" Andy Jason

""Next one'll be on the house, too."" Jenna Devlin

""Vote for Holt!"" Holt Scotto

Music: A +

I loved, loved, loved the music. The travel music was jaunty and perfectly fit the ambiance of the tiny seaside town. Especially cool was the little flute trill that occurred as you finished a puzzle.

Graphics/Video: A +

Getting better and better all the time. Bonus points for the animated sequences such as the whale watching tour.

Technical: B

I'm one of a few people who have had this problem, but no matter what I did, DDI wouldn't fully install on my computer. There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.

Overall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.

If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. All-time favorite.",0

"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product.",0

I've upgraded to every new version of OSX released since 10.1. Each and every version has been worth the money spent in upgrades. The Time Machine feature alone justifies about half the cost of the ugprade.,0
"If your running Win98 or Win ME I would recommend the upgrade to XP. If you just use your PC for everyday email, word processing etc. then you can save money and go with XP Home Edition. However, if you are use to NT or Windows 2000 I would recommend XP Professional for the added administrative features.
I've been using XP since RC1 and it has been rock solid. For a home pc it is the operating system of choice. For business users you can stay with Windows 2000 and do just fine as XP is just a more user friendly version of 2000.
The XP interface is cleaner but offers nothing special. It takes a little while to find all your favorite old setup features as they are kind of hidden in different areas.
Unless your planning on purchasing a new PC I would recommend picking up XP, as long as your current PC has at least 128 megs of RAM.",0
"Yup, the reviews are true: Tiger sped up our eMac (albeit with sme extra RAM thrown in for extra insurance). We also use Apple's Airport Extreme and suddenly, the connection is moving better. Spotlight will find just about anything on your drive (be warned if your family searches for your hidden porn). Widgets are fun: I've added a widget, those free-floating little thingies on your desktop that you can pull down with a click, that tells me best gas prices locally (of SOME stations) and another that searches for lyrics of iTunes tunes (found some; others ain't there).

I had heard a lot of back-and-forth about whether it was ""worth it"" or ""stable"" and it is, on both accounts.

BAD!!! Norton's AntiVirus and Norton Firewall, leftovers from my OS X.2.4 are incompatible with Tiger; no loss, lemme tell ya, unless you really bought the lousy things and now have nothin' for your money.

"Twenty years ago I taught architectural design at the high-school level.  When I think back to how we had to do it then--and how it can be done now with programs like ""Home Designer"" I can only shake my head at the marvels of technology.

Having written that--I do need to point out that while this program can be used by beginners--it sure helps if you have some previous knowledge in architectural design.  If you don't and are interested in learning it--this program will help you--but it requires a time commitment.  There are a lot of videos that take you step by step through the process.  I would agree with an earlier reviewer that it would be nice to ALSO have written directions (perhaps a pdf file if they don't want to include a printed manual).  This way you can view the video to see the steps--but then refer to the written directions when you need them.  Otherwise, it is time consuming to try to find the video section of the direction you need.

If you are a beginner and hoping you can install this and quickly be designing a specific real-life home project you may be a bit disappointed.  It will take some time to understand the program and be able to input the specific information for your project.

Overall, this is a very good program.",0

"Installed the Lantronix USB device server in 10 minutes, just connected to ethernet, installed software, and plugged in devices. I am using it with an epson scanner and an HP Officejet K60- which is supposed to be (acording to hp) non-compatible with a wireless network. I bought this with the expectation it probably wouldn't work with the HP but it did! wireless connection is great- entire network has full control over devices on other side of house, 2 ports left for any other devices I wish to network, couldn't be happier this product was worth the price for me.

Update: When DSL signal is low or reset, device server sometimes needs to be reconnected or reset as well - usually this is just a matter of disconnecting power and usb devices then reconnecting but sometimes pressing the pinhole reset button is required. It can be annoying but it's mostly attributed to my poor dsl signal, other than that still works great, still highly recommend!",0

"I was previously using Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.0 and am surprised at the noticeable difference in the upgrade to 13.0.
The first noticeable difference is my only real criticism - this version took far longer to download than my previous version (and is something other reviewers have noted so apparently it was not an isolated experience).
But once installed, everything runs smoothly and seamlessly.
Included with the software is a high-quality headset but I find myself using my laptop's internal mic instead. This is an area that especially surprised me - the accuracy even without a headset is impressive, thereby saving me the hassle of always traveling with a separate mic.
So far, I have used this in Word, Publisher and for web surfing all with good results. Because I work in media publishing, I am used to triple checking everything so any occasional inaccuracy doesn't bother me - I like having that necessary ""last step"" to check spelling, content and formatting. Even so, this is a huge time saver.
Also,transcriptions from an audio file/voice recorder were close to error-free.
I have had slightly less success using this for web browsing, which I attribute to user error since this is a new function for me.
I doubt many people will routinely use all of the many features found in Naturally Speaking Premium 13.0  but the ones you do rely on are easily mastered and will give most everyone more than satisfactory results.
Whether you are a newcomer or seasoned user of Dragon Naturally Speaking, Premium 13.0 is worth consideration if you are looking to streamline your productivity.",0

"Like others, I had been a long-time user of WordPerfect going back to DOS version 5.  I had upgraded from DOS versions up to WP for Windows version 9 (2000) where I stopped only because most places I worked for were using Word.  One feature I missed the most was Reveal Codes which Word has always been lacking.  I wasn't even sure Corel was still selling WordPerfect Office because I had wanted to purchase it years ago.  It wasn't until I was in the market for moving back to CorelDRAW again that I discovered Corel still owns it.  I'm glad that the loyal users have kept it alive all these years.

I purchased the Home and Student version of Corel WP Office X6 for home use even though I considered getting the Standard release, but I couldn't pass up the great price for this version.

I did have a problem after opening up Word 2007 documents in WP that when I clicked in the header or footer, WP would crash on me.  I don't know if this was due to codes in Word or something else.  I figured the best solution is probably just to copy and paste the text and headers/footers directly in WP. I don't believe it's a WP issue.  My documents in Word are based on a custom template with macros and I figure it has something to do with that.

I was trying to create a new template based on my Word 2007 one and I couldn't find a way to save the document as a template.  The templates included have an extension of WPT, but nowhere in the file format list did I find a way to save as a template for WP.  Was this excluded from the Home and Student version?  If not available, I assume the workaround is to just open an existing WPT file, make my changes then resave as a new template.  I have a feeling I'm going to have to relearn WP again since it's been many years since I last used it.

I had no issues with the download or the installation.  I am running Windows 7 64-bit and all the programs work flawlessly.

I look forward to becoming a loyal Corel user again.",0
"I'm new to Apple/Mac, I finally bought a MacBook Pro after years of flirting with the idea.

I'm seriously impressed by this virtualization. I've done virtualization in the past (virtual linux and such) but let me tell you this is something else, especially in Coherence mode.
If I had known Mac + Parallels + Windows could work like this, I would have made the switch years ago.",0

I love Windows 7. It is probably the best operating system Microsoft has ever made. Windows 8 is aweful. I just hope Windows 10 which will be free for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users will be as good as Windows 7,0

"I use this on an older tablet PC with pretty dated hardware specs, yet Sketchbook installed and runs smooth as silk.  This was my first opportunity to use this program and I must say I am impressed.  In the past, I've used vector-based programs like Illustrator, but if you are a traditional freehand artist who just wants the flexibility of paper tools without compromises like the frustrating pen tool, this is the ticket.  The first thing I noticed when I fired up this app was the weird UI.  It consisted of the traditional menu bar and a weird looking semi-circle type menu in the bottom left of screen.  I later discovered the semi-circle is known as the Lagoon.  After a bit of playing around with the Lagoon, I instantly fell in love with it. You can call up any palette from the Lagoon, adjust colors, pens, sizes, undo errors, and pretty much perform anything available in the program from the Lagoon.  It can also be customized any way you wish.  There are a wide array of brushes and tools available for use.  You can even customize existing brushes, import brushes, or create a whole new brush. Within an hour and without any tutorials or difficulty, I was drawing and exporting cartoons into Photoshop where I balanced and evened everything out for that polished look.  I then exported to base photos to use with Comic Life.  I love the flexibility the tablet gives me.  I also love the fact that this program exports to Photoshop, so you can clean any rough edges and jazz it up even more.  I place cartoon characters against real life backgrounds and add layers of my kids to give the effect that they're in that Roger Rabbit type world.  They love it.  Whether you're a pro or just a casual artist like me, this program fits the bill for easy efficient digital art.",0

"Why did I title my review ""Bowing to the inevitable?"" Because if you aren't a Mac user, you will end up needing this suite of software. The days of bundling software are pretty much over, or you get a suite of also-rans, worthy in themselves but not the gold standard. So if you have a PC at home, you are going to have to pony up to buy Microsoft's most popular workhorses.

Here's what you get:

- Excel 2003

- Outlook 2003

- Powerpoint 2003

- Word 2003

At a glance, you can see this is probably 99 percent of all the software you need, save for a graphics program to manipulate images and photos.

This allows you to do Powerpoints at home, to email using Outlook, which is a very good contact manager, and to have a word processor and spreadsheet.

The price is not cheap but it is reasonable for what you get. For pupils in school and for teachers, it's probably a must.",0
"I've been using Turbo Tax for a decade-plus and continue to find it to be the best of the bunch when it comes to preparing my personal and small business returns.  Simple to use (well, as simple as anything that is based on the US Tax Code can be), reliable and straightforward.

Zero problem importing my past year return, which is a huge time saver.

I like how I can opt to stay within a menu-driven interface or, when needed, jump right into the actual tax form. Their ""for your records"" printouts are also very helpful, although very lengthy (recommend saving it to a PDF unless you want to have your printer chew through a lot of paper).

Wish my tax prep was easier, but Turbo Tax is the best tool I've found to help minimize the trouble and pain of filing tax returns.",0

"I've been using Norton anti-virus and backup products for years.  While they had their installation and usage problems early on, they have gotten better year by year.  This year's edition installs flawlessly on Vista, Win7 and Win8 computers.

Not only that, but Amazon's download prices are the best, far cheaper than purchasing the product directly from Symantec.",0
"I found this product to be accessible, user friendly, and easy to navigate, unlike the last versions of Microsoft office. It also gives you a choice of setups that include Word style for those of you were using the other format and Legal for those who want or need to produce court documents. The interface is similar to the old ""intuitive"" one that Microsoft appears to have left in the dust. On top of that you get a 300+ page well indexed user guide (forget spending hours trying to enter the right keyword into a website!!). After spending three hours and failing miserably at removing an unintended page break from a Microsoft office documents, WordPerfect was a joy to use!

UPDATE: I continue to enjoy this program and have copied several Word documents into it using cut and paste rather than importing them. Why? Because I have been unable to remove some unwanted formatting that Word would not undo. It was a snap in Wordperfect. It is so easy to find anything and everything! The pull down menus' make sense and you can easily scroll through the help guide available in the left-hand menu. I now spend my time actually WRITING. I want to add that I have NO connection to this company. I am a teacher who writes fiction and often has issues opening Microsoft's new Docx formats. I'm sure it can do wonderful things but for those of you who just want to get your ideas down and your formatting correct, this is it!",0

In my case, the upgrade program found one incompatible application on my Windows 7 computer; once that's removed (the upgrade program does it for you when you tell it to go ahead and remove the application), everything went smoothly and it took less than 20 minutes to upgrade.  Then my mother upgraded her Win7 machine, too, and reported no problems.  Microsoft really did an excellent job this time with the upgrade path.",0

"I am amazed at what is being bundled into a $80 product these days.  I've used various video products over the years, including Pinnacle and a variety of free ones, and based on that experience, really like the interface and ease of use of VideoStudio Pro X8.

The power of VideoStudio Pro X8 is that you can relatively quickly come up to speed (there is a learning curve, just to understand the icons and terminology) and do basic video manipulation of a camera or phone video.  And then, there is a lot of room for growth as your skills and experience expand.  VideoStudio Pro X8 also comes with a nice set of images, videos, and sound tracks that you can start with and then expand upon on your own.  This makes doing simple things to liven up your video much easier.

I am a sporadic user of video software.  I will get onto a personal project with family video or something, and will immerse myself into the tool, explorer the capabilities, and then when done, not come back video editing for months.  VideoStudio Pro X8 is easy enough to just use, but it takes a bit to get use to the fine details of the interface and knowing how to shortcut the process.  My only want here is to take the time to put a little info link (i) by all the functionality screens and provide a sentence or two of explanation.

VideoStudio Pro X8 has more capabilities to it than most people will use.  There's an analogy I like to use for products like this.  This product is like the Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).  Each of those products are really easy to use and get work down.  When most people use the products for work or home typical usage, they are only scratching the surface of what the product is capable of.  Until you need it, and if you do, its there.  Seems to me that VideoStudio Pro X8 is the same.",0

"Thanks Symantec...you've officially change my attitude (for the better) about running security software!

I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.

Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.

So, after roughly another year of ""living on the edge"", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).

Here's what I noticed:
+ Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute.
+ Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick.
+ Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.

About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.

So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!",0

Not only does it allow you to do an amazing amount of editing and adding special effects to existing videos it also lets you create screen-capture videos of what is on your computer monitor.

I'm used to working with video software, primarily Camtasia Studio($299), so it didn't take too long to figure out the basics of this program.  However, there are a lot of special effects and techniques that can be used so I was happy to find that Corel has an online site with both video and written tutorials on how to use this software. One feature I want to try next is the ""stop motion animation.""

If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive program that has a lot of advanced features (they claim there are ""hundreds of stunning visual effects"") this would be a program to consider purchasing.  It allows you to import a wide variety of digital media, capture video, and output the videos in a wide range of formats. It also includes a complete disk burning program.

The software can be installed in either 32 or 64-bit!  I'm using it on a 64-bit Windows 7 computer.",0

Can you say you love a tax program? Well the H & R Block Tax software is worthy of that claim. It was easy to install and start using right away.

"A product like this is crying to be compared to the free products out there.  What can it do that something like Paint. NET for example not do.  The truth is that if you don't intend on doing more than cropping pictures to put on your blog and maybe remove some red eye from your pictures from the birthday party then you probably don't need this.  But if you intend on doing more, cleaning up photos beyond the basics then Paint Shop Pro is the right product.  It isn't too expensive and although it has quite a learning curve once you get the hang of using it, it actually is very simple.  The selection tools are great and very accurate which makes adjusting or applying filters to parts of your picture a breeze.  And there are a bunch of filters that can make your pictures look much better.  Even if you aren't the best photographer in the world you can clean up your photos and make them look like they were taken by a professional, to some extent anyway.  I recommend this product.  It is well worth the price.",0
Great!,0
"Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third Nancy Drew game, and far superior compared to the first two. This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal ""Nancy Drew case formula"". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as ""there must always be four suspects"" and ""there must always be a long-lost treasure"".

Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?

The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first ""haunted house"" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.

I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.

Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.

The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.

The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.

One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.

The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.

Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.",0
"A very good antivirus-antispyware.
I've used a lot of different antivirus programs in the past but will probably stick with this one in the future.
For one thing it's easy to install and works well. It also doesn't slow down your computer when the program is running and another plus is the fact that it can be used one more than one computer. Just make sure that you first delete any other antivirus programs that may already be on your computer, otherwise the programs may conflict.",0

"This is one of the best operating systems out there ever. It's earned a tie with Windows 7 Ultimate because of the fact that unlike Snow Leopard and later or especially Lion or later (don't even get me started on Mavericks or Yosemite and later) it works in a fashion that combines what is great about Mac OS X with what is great about the Classic Mac OS. Snow Leopard stripped out tons of valuable features, and Lion and later replaced them with ever more modern iPhone and iPad integration. The problem with this is ""What do you do if you're a long-time Mac user on a limited budget, who can't afford new Mac hardware unless it's getting you a return on your investment as regards the Mac plus AppleCare?"" I bought a Snow Leopard MacBook Pro, bought AppleCare, and when my school was recommending against Mac users upgrading to Lion, or even to Safari 5.1 on Snow Leopard, I was stuck. Apple wouldn't support me if I didn't run the latest software, and my school was telling me they couldn't guarantee I could do my schoolwork if I updated.

Eventually, due to hassles such as this, I had to drop out of college and I don't know when I'll ever be able to go back. But what I can say is that Leopard 10.5.4 on every machine I've had the pleasure of using it has produced an experience that does what Apple claims future Mac hardware and software will also do, but more importantly, will remain compatible with several Mac OS 9.2.2 systems I use for serious work because Mac Pros have not dropped in price enough to justify them, so I use a dual-monitor Power Mac G4 Quicksilver and a single-monitor Power Mac G4 Cube for the tasks most people buy a Mac Pro or iMac to do and then just simply convert the files to modern formats on my Intel Macs (a Early 2008 MB325LL/A iMac and a Mid 2007 MB138LL/A Mac mini.)

I am disappointed not in Mavericks, but in the fact that the hardware capable of running it is not reliable enough when running it. Leopard may be much less future forward, but it was the one true gem of the Mac OS X family.",0

"I have been a big fan of Roxio Creator for well over a decade.  Creator NXT is the 2013 updated edition for those of us who create videos for disc or online, rip music to MP3s, create professional looking photo slideshows or even printed keepsakes such as calendars or posters with the included PaintShop Pro X4.

PaintShop Pro has become my PRIMARY photo editing software, despite having access to several great photo editing programs, albeit I usually use PaintShop Pro X5 or X6 (2013). If you are working with photos, videos, or audio and want professional results, ON A BUDGET, Creator NXT with PaintShop Pro X4 is by far the best bet in my book.  This package is ideal for someone newer to dabbling with audio, video and/or photos and need to learn and USE the basics without breaking the bank.",0

"I have been using Norton for my internet security for quite some time.  It was coming up on my renewal time - so, I clicked on the renewal pop-up when it came up - but the price from Norton seemed much higher than I remembered.  So, I went to Amazon - I got the same software at a much lower price.  Same good protection - lower price.",0
"This product continues the tradition of slow bloated software.  The program size at over 300Mb is bigger than ever(and slower to).  As the same for the clunky Norton 2007 every time you install a new piece of software with Antivirus 2008 the junk Norton will force a scan of your system(even if auto-protect is turned off).  So if you have an older slower machine be prepared to wait 15 minutes after you install a piece of software before you try out the new program because Norton Antivirus 2008 will hijack your machine without your permission and make it virtually unusable until it finishes scanning.

Last year I tried out Norton Antivirus 2007 and Kaspersky.  Kaspersky found a KEYSTROKE LOGGER that Norton totally missed.  I would not expect this clunky 2008 version to be any better.

Also keep in mind that Norton will charge at least 40 bucks a year to renew the 1 year virus signature subscription.  Avoid the expensive and sluggish Norton moneypit.",0
"I have used every Microsoft OS since DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1. Until now my favorite was Windows 2000. XP was pretty solid (after service pack 2) except for all of the security holes. Every time I would need to fix an XP machine it wasn't because of something wrong with the OS itself, but because the machine had virus/spyware/trojans etc. Enter Vista. MS fixed most of the security problems but did so at the expense of performance and stability. Now with Windows 7 you get the best of both worlds. XP was released in 2001 and hardware has come a long way since then, but the OS itself remained relatively static and could only take advantage of newer hardware at a basic level. Vista was an improvement and Windows 7 handles it better still.

I think Vista, although I had few problems with it, will go down as ME 2.0. At the same time Windows 7 will be XP 2.0. People will cling to it and MS will have to kill it off before people will move on to it's next offering, whatever that may be.

With that said I would highly recommend that both XP and Vista users upgrade. Unlike previous upgrades you will actually get better performance and use less resources post-upgrade. A first for MS. Security is rock solid. If XP is swiss cheese, then Win 7 is the wall of China. You no longer have to download the ""patch of the day"" from Windows Update. I haven't played around with Media Player, but Media Center is great for watching DVDs and remains pretty much unchanged from Vista. My favorite features are Jump Lists, AERO Snap (for working in two windows side by side). Networking is a bit easier (especially compared to XP). Performance is much improved from Vista and is comparable to or even faster than XP. Calculator, Paint, and Wordpad have been updated. If you are upgrading from Vista you do lose a couple of progams, namely Windows Mail and Photo Gallery. Updated versions can be downloaded from Windows Update for free. The only downside is that upgrading from XP requires a clean install.

As far as the upgrade process itself goes, it's painless. Just be sure to run the upgrade advisor before you do. All that's required of you is a product key (at the end of the installation) and activation. So all you have to do is pop the disc in, grab a good book, and before you know it you're in computing heaven.",0

I've been a user of Kaspersky for several years on 3 different computers and continue to enjoy having it protect my computers.

"We used QuickBooks through 2003 at my previous company. It was a clean and simple way to keep detailed, accurate books for our business, which grew to the $2 Million level. I ordered the 2010 version for a new organization, and checked it out to make sure that Intuit had not somehow ruined it in the last few years.

No worries. QuickBooks is better than ever. It has struck that unique balance between ease-of-use and raw power that many software packages attempt but most fail to achieve. Using QuickBooks, you can enter your transactions (checks, deposits) as if you were just managing your checkbook, while the program keeps full double-entry accounting records behind the scenes. You get simple entry, your accountant and the tax man get clean balance sheets and cash flows.

Some caveats:

1. The biggest complaint that the pros have about Quickbooks is that it is possible to delete a transaction completely. That is, if you make a mistake, you can delete the transaction and it is gone forever. In the world of professional accountants, this is a bad thing, but in the real world of running profitable small businesses, I believe it is acceptable.

2. If you want to keep clean, complete books, you need to set up a proper chart of accounts, and you need to enter transactions properly. This is quite simple, but not 100% transparent for a raw beginner with no bookkeeping background. My advice: Get an accountant with QuickBooks experience to set up QuickBooks for your business, and to give you 1-2 hours of training. This small investment will pay for itself many times over. Do not let the accountant convince you that QuickBooks won't work for some reason. QuickBooks is by far the most widely used bookkeeping program in the world, and it will work in virtually every case.

3. I believe that the best way to use QuickBooks is like this: Designate one person as the Entry person. This is usually the bookkeeper or office manager. Their job is to cut checks, enter transactions, and prepare reports. Designate another person as the Check Signer (usually the Boss/Owner). Their job is to review reports and sign checks. Never, never, never allow the person who cuts checks to sign them, not even small checks. This will help eliminate the vast majority of fraud opportunities.

4. Be sure to choose the correct version of QuickBooks. Some versions allow multiple simultaneous users, others include payroll, etc.

Recommendation: Five stars, highly recommended for small businesses.",0
I tried an earlier version of this a while back and had problems with it needing some microsoft subprogram. This time it worked great.

"First of all, it is 3 ""installations"" only, not 3 PCs. Don't be fooled by the marketing tricks.

As like other virus tools, you need to uninstall old virus protection tool from your computer before installing the Norton 360 V5. Installation is exceptionally fast and within a minute or two, Norton 360 V5 is up and running.

The scans are done in the background. And it DOESN'T slow my PC while the scan is running. Computer feels the same way as it were stock. Also, it scans fast, much faster than my previous McAfee.

No major annoying popups. Only one I've encountered are ""High Resource Usage"", which I confirmed high system memory usage with window task manager.

Parental Controls are mediocre.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places. This is a big plus for people who are active on that social media sites. A useful feature !!

This version comes with a startup manager to help you to disable startup programs that you don't use or that you don't want to start up.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

In summary, a faster and less resource-demanding virus protection tool with real useful add-on features. I highly recommend it.",0

"So far I am having fun with this software.  Great product.  I have learned some about taking pictures from it.  Highly underexposed photo don,t seem to be able to be imporved by much.  Over exposed photos work great with this software.  Removing unwanted background is easy and lots of fun.  Removing glases sun light or light bulb glare is also easy, fun and impresive.  Red eye clean up is the best. The only problem I have had is registering.  Two phone calls and two emails and I finally got it registered.  Yeaaaaa.
 When touring sometimes I am taking pic into or near the sun.  Sometimes I am taking pic through the window.  These photos don,t come out to good until I use this software.  They clean up pretty well.",0

"This edition of Windows XP is primarily business oriented, but there are certain features that would be useful in the Home Edition of Windows XP. Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is ""awesome"", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The ""start menu"", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the ""start menu"" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, ""ME"" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. ""KODAK"". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home. It all depends on the user and the environment, as simple as that.",0
Office 365 is less than $100 per year for 5 users.  We purchased this and our kids use it on their Macs while my wife and I use it on our PC's.  What did we do with the 5th license?  Donated it to a friend who is a single mom and widow.  It's really nice to have that flexibility.,0
"I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. during that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just a huge increase in software bugs.

Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.

In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.

Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams.

The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.",0
"Most laptops/notebooks seem to ship with Windows 7 Home Premium rather than Windows 7 Professional.  That is probably fine for most users.  However, if you need your Windows 7 Notebook to be part of a business domain network, you need Windows 7 Professional.  This upgrade is how you accomplish the change.

It turns out that Windows 7 Home Premium already contains Windows 7 Professional; it is simply not enabled.  When you buy this upgrade you are getting an upgrade key.  No disk, just a key sticker and very brief instructions.  Key it in pursuant to the laughably simple instructions and within minutes you will be running Windows 7 Professional.  One caveat: apparently you cannot upgrade from Windows 7 32 to Windows 7 64 bit.  This will affect very few users as I do not believe that hardly any computers are shipping with 32 bit Windows 7.  Nor should they.  Windows 7 64 bit is very compatible with existing 32 bit software, and in the future we can expect lots of 64 bit software and we all want to be ready for it.

Some have criticized Microsoft for charging for the upgrade from Home Premium to Professional, but my opinion (which is only that) is that Microsoft makes its living by selling operating system software and this is one way for them to do it.  At least the upgrade is easy, painless, and quick.  RJB.",0

"I've used other photo editing programs in the past, including Adobe Photoshop. The majority of my photo editing is simple fixes such as removing red eye, scratches, and other small improvements.

"If you are looking for something to take you to the next level with your new pen tablet, this is the perfect choice.  There are several software options with a lot of extras and even more to learn.  However, here you have a a function that just works smoothly, without fear of complexity, and you are creating as soon as you start the program.

I have a Mac and a PC.  The PC being a bit older and the iMac within the past year.  This works just as well on both, but I am preferring the Mac.  I also have two pen tablet from Wacom... the easy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bamboo-Fun-Tablet/dp/B000V9RL6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bamboo Fun Tablet</a>&nbsp;and the omg version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-Intuos4-Tablet/dp/B001TUYTZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom Intuos4 Tablet</a>.  The combo of my Mac, SketchBook Pro 2010, and my  Intuos4 is quite a fascinating creative outlet.

You don't need to have a pen tablet for this software, but as soon as you try this, you will get one.  There is not much to learn here.  You install, and it gives you the widest screen possible to paint, sketch, edit, write, and just have fun.  Even at the retail price, this is quite the bargain.  Compared to some other software options out there, this is the place to begin.  Work your way up to something more advanced later on, but this is quite advanced for my use.

My favorite part about this is that I feel like I am going back to something that I have neglected for years, and that is pen and ink drawing.  I was avidly creating very detailed work to the point of looking like photographs.  It's partly due to my slight OCD, but all that matters is that I must be able to control the detail.  Never in a million years would I have thought I could do this on my computer.  I actually feel reunited with my Rapidograph pen I used in College.

There are other functions here that go beyond art, as you can edit scanned photos, blueprints, layouts, touch up, repair, alterations of previous works, etc..  Even if you were to buy this for photo editing alone, it's worth the investment.  The memory functions are a plus as you can create little snippets of your work, and add them to something else.  One thing I could think of that would be useful for is interior design.  i.e. create a couch, and add the couch to any work, or duplicate it etc.  I look forward to expanding my personal creativity as I continue to find the benefits of this software.",0

"I've used various apps by Cyberlink  for a while now and they have always been solid performers.  The PowerDirector software is no different.  It can be installed from the supplied DVDs or installed by downloading it from their website.  A lot of people might used this software to edit videos for the web so this is handy if you're installing it on a laptop that doesn't have a built in DVD drive.

The version I have is the Ultra version... it also comes in a standard version that has less features.  Quite honestly, for most people the standard version might do everything you need so you might want to check the differences between the versions.  Cyberlink's website has a nice comparison chart.

My use of the software is mainly to edit videos and create disks with multiple videos selectable from a menu.  The editing is pretty straight forward (similar to most other programs).  If you've never edited video, there is a learning curve.  On the Cyberlink site, you can download an ebook ""PowerDirector14 Tutorial"" that really helps learn this app.  That said, PowerDirector tries to make it easy.  However, you can tweak almost everything.  The defaults for outputting video are a good example... the quality settings all work well but you do have control over the settings.

The software contains a ton of preset transitions, backgrounds, titles, menus, and filters.... all editable.  You can also make and add your own.  In some respects, there's almost too much to choose from (not a bad thing!).  As mentioned before, it also has a lot of preset output (DVD, YouTube, etc) that make getting good quality final videos easy.

The only caveat I could mention is that you really need a good, powerful PC for this software to work well (as most of this type of software needs). The more memory and hard disk space you have, the better it will perform.  I first tried it on my laptop (i5, 8GB memory, and 256GB SSD)... it was OK but you did have to wait while it did some things.  I then moved it over to my desktop (i7, 16GB memory, 256GB boot SSD, 2GB hybrid drive) and it ran great. If you're doing a lot of editing, you need a powerful computer.

So far I would recommend everyone take a look and consider this software.  You get a lot of functionality for the money. It works and works well.",0

"Norton AntiVirus 2006 [Old Version]-  I purchased the program from the lower cost used section of the Amazon product listing section.  The only difference between the one I received and a new one was the outer packaging carton.  No problem after installation.  Much lower cost.

"I'm very pleased with the size and quality of the product.  It's tiny, with just enough of the unit exposed so that it can be easily grasped and removed.  It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

I'm really glad that I bought it based both on the performance & the fact that it was a third of the cost of similar items sold in local stores.",0

"I have been using many different types of Anti-virus and Anti-spyware products for many years. The Norton 360 ranks amongst the top for the following reasons :

- Stability. I seldom have any installation issues installing this software on my PCs with different OS (XP and Vista) and hardware configurations

- Speed. Virus scanning is relatively fast as compared to other products

- Automated scheduled scanning for tuning up your PC.

The feature which I did not enjoy was the backup function. The functionality and performance are not as good as Acronis True image",0
"While I can review a computer game after ""beating it"" - often a week or two after purchase - with Norton 360 I waited several months after installing it to come to any judgement. There is always a learning curve with any serious software product where you tweak the settings, learn what combination works well for you, and so on. I really feel a serious package like this should be tested out for many weeks - not days - before a decision is made about it.

I run Norton 360 on my main home PC, from which I run several websites. This means I am running database development software, graphic editing software, video editing software, logging software and much more on this machine. Plus I'm a game reviewer, so I'm running some pretty intensive games on it as well. My machine does a great variety of things. You would think if an issue was going to trigger, that I'd probably trigger it.

I definitely agree that you need to spend a little time setting up the software to work well with your surfing and net patterns. Someone who does a lot of networking operations might need ports more open than someone who just reads email and wants their computer locked up tightly. Now, that being said, the interface is rather straightforward to do this. Once you set it up, you're all set.

I haven't run into any issues with Norton 360 once it was set up well. Yes I had to do some tweaking to get my various POP mail accounts working - many of which are customized and using non-standard ports. It was a one time operation, and has been set since then.

In terms of the quality of the anti-virus software, I always give Norton very high marks. Our cable company provided free anti-virus software as part of our cable bill. Virusses got right through their ""shield"". When I put on Norton, Norton instantly spotted those virusses and eliminated them without any fuss.

I completely agree that some systems out there might have issues with this software package, just like some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. Where an XBox 360 is a perfect clone of every other XBox 360 out there, every PC is unique. Every person has different internet settings, different mail software, and perhaps most importantly, different virusses and spyware that have snuck on your system. Undoubtedly there is always going to be some unique blend of these things that causes a system to crash - with OR without Norton 360. In general, though, I really feel Norton 360 should work extremely well on most systems.

Well recommended - but as always, back up your system before beginning, and have your network documentation handy so you know which specific ports you happen to be personally using, to keep those open.",0

"Turbo Tax downloaded and installed flawlessly, was cheaper than buying a boxed version and it did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I can't comment on customer service because I did not have any reason to use it, which is another good reason for me to use Turbo Tax again next year.

I can not compare this to other tax software, simply because I have never used tax software from any company before this year. But based on my experience with this version, I am certainly going to put Turbo Tax at the top of the list for next year.

"I was a little skeptical about going from Windows XP to Windows 8, due to the drastic difference in the way the programs are written. After a few choice words and shaking my fist at my computer, and also calling up my Grandson several times a day to figure out how to use Windows 8, I finally got the hang of it. It loads a whole lot faster than Windows XP and has so many more capabilities than XP did. although Windows 8 was primarily designed for touchscreen use, it also works very well without touchscreen. When my old monitor gives up, I'll upgrade to a touchscreen, but for now its smooth sailing with Windows 8. It is definitely a real improvement over XP, but it does take a little getting used to. I'm glad that I upgraded to Windows 8 and upgraded my computer at the same time, because now there's no more setting and waiting for my programs to load. When I push the buttons now, (Kaboom) my programs load almost instantaneously, no more setting and waiting! I definitely recommend upgrading to Windows 8!",0

She is not super computer savvy, but wants to turn her art into computer-type comics or maybe graphics for t-shirts. The Bamboo Spark helps her use her love for drawing by hand with a pen, into a computer image, but she needed a program to help refine and color her drawings.

We have Adobe Photoshop student edition, but it is really suited more for photos. She can use it and enjoys it, but she doesn't really like it for drawings. She thought this would be a nice tool that would work for both photos and drawings. She loves it so far!

It is definitely powerful. There are so many features that we just are learning. I was almost embarrassed to try to write a review because so many of them are written by people who are skilled with these programs and zoom through all the features right out of the box. But then I figured that there must be other people like us who are beginners and looking to learn...everyone had to be a beginner once, right!? ha ha

We like that there is a tour right away to help you get started. There are also a bunch of videos available to help you with what you want to do. I know when she first started with the Photoshop, and wanted to so something like a gradient, the internet was a huge help to walk you through step by step, and then you felt more comfortable with improving on that if you wanted. I know this program isn't as popular as Adobe, so there might not be as many instructional pages around, but we chose Corel anyway. I have always found Corel items just to be more simple and intuitive. I am a huge fan of WordPerfect and update that all the time. I always get complements on my documents and people always want to know how I did something...and I tell them you gotta ditch that crappy MS word! ha ha!

I really like that we can just use this without a lot of training or experience and without subscription. It isn't cheap upfront, but it is a powerful program. You can get cheaper or free stuff, but it just doesn't have the tools needed to really be creative. This is a wonderful introduction to a higher level.",0

"I can't change the rating stars on this, so I will just preface my edited review instead.  My enthusiasm for this product would be total were it not for McAfee's inability to resolve a simple problem:  How to register the product so that the defense files would be updated regularly.

All that was accomplished after 5 separate sessions with McAfee Support was the exhaustion of my patience and the rising of my temper.

Go ahead and try this product, I still mean everything that I wrote below.  Maybe your version will install and register just fine.  My version won't and I'm returning the CD to McAfee.

==========================

Maybe I wouldn't be so enthusiastic about McAfee Total Protection 2008 if I hadn't had such a bad experience with Microsoft OneCare.  That said, for me... this product is everything that OneCare is NOT!  It's easy to install, taking only a few minutes on my Vista-powered machine and it nicely coexists with all of my software and peripherals, even to the point of finally (yes.. finally) making the network connection between my Sony Vaio notebook and my wife's iMac work.

How ironic is it that McAfee could coexist better with Vista than Microsoft's own product?

If you're confused by the disparity between various reviews of McAfee Total Protection 2008, I can't say as I blame you.  But in truth, that's the nature of the beast when it comes to personal computing these days.  Memory usage, processor speed and cache responsiveness will influence what works for you (and against you) while the guy next door working with a different configuration will get totally different results.  So with that in mind, here's a link to the PC that I installed this product on
a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-VAIO-VGN-N220E-B-15-4-Laptop-Intel-Pentium-D-T2060-1-6-GHz-Processor-1-GB-RAM-80-GB-Hard-Drive-DVD-RW-Drive-Vista-Premium-Black/dp/B000M5NJPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony VAIO VGN-N220E/B 15.4"" Laptop (Intel Pentium D T2060 1.6 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD RW Drive, Vista Premium) Black</a>.  You can decide for yourself it it's close to the configuration of your machine.

I've been using McAfee anti-virus protection for a few years now so that was a no-brainer.  But the spyware protection and anti-phishing functions are great.  Total Protection gives me instant validation of some of my spam-related fears, preventing me from letting my curiosity lead me down an internet rabbit hole.

Whereas OneCare could never seem to coexist with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linksys-WRT54GS-Wireless-G-Broadband-Router-with-SpeedBooster/dp/B0001D3K8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster</a>, McAfee practically kissed the router on the cheek and got on with its business.

The first backup that I performed with Total Protection not only went smoothly, but I was able to back up documents, music and a ton of jpeg images to a flash drive with an almost unbelievable compression ratio, leaving plenty of room to spare.  Uh... OneCare not only could back up the same data to that drive, it couldn't allow me to change the destination, hosing up mid-backup.

Another function that seemed to get superior results was in the Registry cleanup.  Keep in mind, I just used OneCare to ""clean"" registry three months ago.  That said, Total Protection found plenty of things to fix and remove, and I have better system performance to show for it.

Last but not least, I like the ability to digitally ""shred"" confidential files.  Any CSI or Law and Order viewer knows that no computer file is ever truly clean of deleted files but with Total Protection I feel much, much more secure.

Bottom line... for me, Microsoft OneCare was definitively NOT the answer.  McAfee Total Protection 2008 DEFINITELY WAS!",0
"I have used other virus protection products, including Mcafee and Kaspersky, over the years and they either seem unfriendly in some way, like too many alerts or difficulty in setting up and understanding.  The value of my personal data is beyond the use of ""free"" virus s/w although there is a place for them, like on a second or third computer that you would like some protection for, but, really don't need that much protection.  But, then, with s/w like this, a 3 pack, why have different s/w on each machine?  Pick one for all of your machines to make your life simpler.

My only concern with Norton is that I still don't know how to completely ""shut it off"".  That is, I weekly backup my computers to an external hard drive.  Sometimes I just do an image, sometimes I clone.  I am concerned about things running in the background that may corrupt the image or clone.  I usually turn off the internet, but some, like Norton, like to run in the background when nothing else is running.  That's great for CPU performance, but, I really don't want it running when backing up.  I'm still not sure exactly how to tell it to STOP!

I can't remember any time when Norton, or the others for that matter, have let me down and have allowed my system to be corrupted.  I simply have more confidence in Norton.  For me, it's simply - would you rather buy a GM or FORD or a Yugo, if you remember that brand?

I have downloaded s/w from Amazon and others and have been okay with not having the discs themselves.  With these ""multi-user"" licenses, I prefer to order the discs. That way, I can keep better track of how many licenses I have used.",0
"I purchased Sketch Book Pro specifically for doing initial (draft) sketches of network diagrams, flow-charts, and other telecom engineering work. In the past I've found most drawing programs to either be lacking in features or far too complex to learn and use for simple sketches. What I needed was a program that could allow me to do a mix of vector object placement and drawing as well as free-hand sketching (with a Wacom tablet). Having tried many programs (like Iluustrator and Corel) I found them to be geared towards artists and designers as well they should be. I had resorted to using Microsoft OneNote (which I still use for other purposes) for sketches.

Sketch Book Pro offers the simplicity of doodle/sketching with some of the finer features of a mature drawing application such as pressure sensitive support and controls,support for gestures, flexible placement of pallets, etc.

In addition to these benefits it is a very reasonable price compared to other products. I do not use the painting features, but the pencil, marker, and other features are perfect for sketching and initial concept work. Compared to doing a first draft in Visio, freehand sketching a network design with Sketch Book Pro and the Wacom takes about 1/8th of the time.

I also use it for whiteboarding with engineers using desktop sharing with presentation/conferencing software.",0

"Norton is THE BEST when it comes to internet security.  This particular product gives you 3 licenses, which you know you're eventually going to want another license if you buy computers often, so I definitely recommend going ahead and getting the 3 pack like this.  Norton has prevented several viruses from infecting my computer.  When I've tried competitors they've let things through.  I also love the Norton 360 for the password management system, which keeps track of all your passwords even across computers.  It really is a game-changing product.  I would not own a computer without Norton installed on it.",0
"SKETCHBOOK PRO 2011 contains DVD two discs that can be used on either a Windows or Mac based computer. You do need a DVD drive to use it (three of our home computers don't have a DVD drive). You also need a mouse, that's all you need.

This is a fun program in which you manipulate the mouse to make art. Since I own and use Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 I note some of the controls are quite similar such as selecting the tool and opacity and working with layers.

To start, you just click on the type of medium you want to use (i.e. marker, pencil, paintbrush) then select the thickness, color, and opacity and you are off and running. The menu bar is in the corner and you can expand some of them if you find that easier.

I started fooling around with this without directions, since none came in a paper form and I'm a book person. However there are tutorial documents on the disc to help you. On a whim I used an internet search engine and found video tutorials from the manufacturer on YouTube. These helped me the most.

I am an amateur artist and enjoy this program. I let my kids test it out, they are aged 10 and 13 and both found it simple. They used the tools intuitively and found more features than I realized existed. They really liked the split screen mirror image tool and the one that repeats in the four quadrants what you do on the screen (imagine drawing with one line but seeing an image like a kaleidoscope).

Since I am new to making digital art, I realize there's a learning curve. While I can control a regular drawing pencil in my hand to sketch on paper, it's a completely different skill to use the mouse to replicate the same thing. It's an odd feeling to try to do something you know you can do with pencil and paper but struggle to make a smooth or straight line with the mouse as the tool. In the beginning it feels like a trick on the mind to use a mouse and see the medium you usually associate with a regular marker, paintbrush, or pencil making magic on the screen.

I have no compaints about this product.

As with any computer program or with any traditional art medium, what you get out of it depends both on what you want to do with it (translating your concept to reality) and also how much time you put into learning the skills, procedures and techniques necessary to get it to do what you want it to do. I'm a newbie and I find this program fun so far.",0

"I've used Norton 360 since 2009, except for a 6 month time period about a year ago when I tried Avast-Free which left me with 2 Trojan files that Norton 360 picked up on the minute I re-installed it. Since this is a 3 PC copy, I also installed it on my old desktop PC I use for work projects, and on my netbook. This runs unobtrusively in the background, even when doing a short scan, and doesn't slow any of my PC's down.

Here is what I have mine installed on:

Home Desktop PC: Windows 8.1, 3.4 Ghz Processor, 4 GB memory, Chrome browser
Home Netbook: Windows 7 Starter, 1.66 Ghz Processor, 2 GB memory, Mozilla Firefox browser, latest version
Old Desktop PC: Windows XP Professional, 2.4 Ghz Processor, with only 512K memory

I also think it's smarter to purchase the CD in lieu of downloading from Amazon. I like to have a physical copy in my hand in lieu of a download. Similarly, buy the CD instead of updating direct from Norton's web site. It's always more expensive from Symantec's site than buying a new installation CD here.",0

I hate all the ads and cross selling and wish they would stop, but there is no hope of that.

"(Edited to reflect an observation from Mr. Hurley)

This software does not change much from year to year. The reason we keep buying it is that the ""online"" features expire after three years. Personally I am quite comfortable with this arrangement. This year's model features many bug fixes, according to the Intuit web pile. New features include a free credit report. I have not tried that feature, so I don't know how good it is. I found the upgrade installation to be perfect: no issues, no lost data, and reasonably quick.

It would be perfectly sensible to buy it every three years.

This is simply the best software of its kind available. Since Microsoft Money crapped out, there is no other software product that even comes close, in terms of features or usability. In my use, it is stable and dependable.

I believe that anyone with either a family or a decent income should use Quicken. Spending and saving your money involves decisions every day. It is better to drive those decisions with data than to rely solely on your instincts.

The modern alternative to Quicken is a fully web-based, free service such as Mint. You get what you pay for. You give away your privacy too.

Me, I will stick with Quicken as long as it is available. I back up my home computer frequently. My financial data is private and secure, living on my home disk drive and my encrypted backup drives.",0

"Most laptops/notebooks seem to ship with Windows 7 Home Premium rather than Windows 7 Professional.  That is probably fine for most users.  However, if you need your Windows 7 Notebook to be part of a business domain network, you need Windows 7 Professional.  This upgrade is how you accomplish the change.

It turns out that Windows 7 Home Premium already contains Windows 7 Professional; it is simply not enabled.  When you buy this upgrade you are getting an upgrade key.  No disk, just a key sticker and very brief instructions.  Key it in pursuant to the laughably simple instructions and within minutes you will be running Windows 7 Professional.  One caveat: apparently you cannot upgrade from Windows 7 32 to Windows 7 64 bit.  This will affect very few users as I do not believe that hardly any computers are shipping with 32 bit Windows 7.  Nor should they.  Windows 7 64 bit is very compatible with existing 32 bit software, and in the future we can expect lots of 64 bit software and we all want to be ready for it.

Some have criticized Microsoft for charging for the upgrade from Home Premium to Professional, but my opinion (which is only that) is that Microsoft makes its living by selling operating system software and this is one way for them to do it.  At least the upgrade is easy, painless, and quick.  RJB.",0
"At $13 who can argue with this?!?!?  This Titanium Internet Security is the mid-level software from Trend Micro.

"Symantec's,  Norton Internet Security, aka NIS, has been around for a while. I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since it was invented, I think. It hasn't caught every virus, or every malware, or all the other junk that comes my way, but it gets better and better, and in my opinion, I believe it is better overall than any other single program out there.

To be fair, I do use the free programs, Ad-Aware and Spybot Search and Destroy, when I believe I have been to a suspicious site, or that I have been compromised, and NIS hasn't caught anything. I don't believe any one program can catch it all as NIS, Ad-Aware, and Spybot, can all catch something that each of the others don't.

Symantec can be a pain for customer support sometimes, but I guess I've gotten so used to using their FAQ that I can solve most problems myself. The most common in the past several years, is the program not recognizing that you've just bought the latest edition of the software and it tells you your subscription (free upgrades during the year) is about to expire.  You have to go in and monkey around to get it to reset and each year I cannot remember how I did it the year before so I have to look it up again.",0
"I was using Windows 98SE and overall was happy with it.  While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).  It seems like the Microsoft engineers really gave this a lot of thought and put it into action.",0

"I have never worked with video editing, or burned CD/DVD except for drag-and-drop operation to backup files. After working with this package for a couple of days, I think it is absolutely great for the casual user who wants to create some nice looking video packages.

Pro:
Very powerful. One can edit each individual clip down to the frame, then integrate it into the project. There are separate tracks for video, overlay video, titles, sound, and voice over. The included effects allow one to create professional looking titles and basic video effects. To operate the program, one simply imports the video clips, sounds, etc. onto a working area, then drags the appropriate item into the timeline. It supports blu-ray and DVD burning. I don't have a Blu-Ray burner, so I only burned DVDs.

There is an express interface for those who want to avoid the complexity of the full timeline interface. I quickly went to the detailed menus to do what I wanted; if you have any experience with Flash (which uses the timeline style construction), you will have no problem working with this software.

A separate burning package is included called DVD Factory Pro; it is run from within the X3 software. It does a good job of rendering and burning. It is fully capable of using multi-CPU, and I found that my quad core AMD worked a LOT faster than my single core Pentium!

The program makes use of the hardware on the video card for faster display while working, including using smaller size images if desired. So all of the PC hardware can be utilized.

The program offers to let you download DVD Factory 7 SE, which is a stand alone program very similar to the DVD Factory Pro, except that one cannot access the DVD Factory Pro except from within the X3 program. I'm not sure that it was necessary, but it is nice for a quick burn project.

Con:
There is some inconsistency in how the software finds it's source files. One has to navigate to get videos, for example, and then when you want to open a different kind of file, it remembers the video location. It would be much better if it remembered separate locations for the different kinds of files. It was quite frustrating; I ended up opening folders for each of the data types, so I could simply paste in the folder location quickly. Once the files are inside the program there is no issue.

There is no indication inside the main program of how much space the project will take when it burns to DVD, and even the burner application does not tell you until you actually get to the final screens. It seems to me that the original program should be able to calculate the space being generated, so one could cut down the project to fit - before starting the burning program.

Conclusion: Excellent package. It will take a bit of time to learn all the features, but even a novice like me can make really great looking videos using this software. Highly recommended.",0

"In a world where... sorry. But seriously, in a world where owners manuals are few and far between, the fact that this baby came loaded with them should have been a clear indication I was dealing with a complex program.

Let's face it, video editing is complex. Period. I appreciate the fact that a software maker respected that fact enough to include several manuals. They made the introduction of the app much easier. I didn't say easy.

Along with complex, the Power Director 11 suite is incredibly powerful. Far beyond my simplistic needs - yet, somehow, very affordable. How can they do that when another big-name software designer feels their product is worthy of a couple weeks' income? Perhaps because you'll be married to it, they figure it should cost like a ring!

If you are interested in video editing and want incredible flexibility, power, relative simplicity and the thoughfulness of real, printed manuals, you've found it. Cyberlink has a winner here.",0

"We use QuickBooks for a small business and we have a CPA do our taxes, so we probably could do without upgrading every year. This year, it's worthwhile. The 2013 version has the same expanded interface that was introduced in 2012, keeping customer info visible as you work. It allows you to attach proposals, receipts, and other documents to invoices to help keep data together, and it makes it easy to upload data from spreadsheets. These additions allow you to integrate data more easily, and are a big help for a small business.

Also helpful: batch invoicing. If you have a number of customers using the same services, you can send all their invoices at once, for a significant time savings.

The other new features are a quicker way to reconcile your bank statements with QuickBooks and a new payment option with the Intuit Payment Network.

"WinZip 15 is available in two packages:  WinZip Standard and the full-featured WinZip Pro.  This review is of WinZip Standard which also came with WinZip Courier.

WinZip has won accolade after accolade since it was first introduced in 1991 for being one of the best file compression software packages.  If you are interested in compressing files to send as emails, to reduce the size of your archives or to save space on your computer, then you should certainly consider WinZip.  If you are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version of WinZip, you may want to question the advantages of doing so.

Compression Speed
I have been using WinZip 7 for years and so I expected much faster performance with WinZip 15, especially since WinZip advertises that version 15 has a brand new zip engine which requires less time to compress files.  However, I found that despite the new zip engine, the speed of the file compression was about the same as the older version that I had been using.  This may be a function of the age of my computer, but overall, the lack of any noticeable increase in speed was disappointing given the difference in the age of the versions I was using.  Therefore, I don't really see any real advantage of upgrading to WinZip 15 if you are using an older version of WinZip unless you can take advantage of the zipx file.

Zipx File
When using WinZip 15 to compress files, the user has the option of choosing the legacy compression (zip file) or the zipx file which was introduced in WinZip 12.  Zipx offers the advantage of creating smaller compressed files.  However, while zip files can be opened by most compression utilities including the one installed with Windows, zipx files can only be opened by WinZip 12 or later or by a few other compression utilities.  Therefore, zipx files are not as ideal for compressing files you plan to share with others.  To see the difference between the zip and zipx files, I zipped the contents of the My Documents folder which included photos and other multimedia.  The zip file resulted in 25% compression while the zipx file resulted in 33% compression.  However, I have also tried compare the results of compressing Word documents which have lots of images included.  I found that the zipx compression resulted in files that were actually slightly larger than the comparable zip files. The same also happened when I tried to zip mp3 files.  However, in the case of jpeg files, zipx files are 20% smaller than the original or the zip file.  While the advantage of the zipx file is not staggering, it is an improvement if you are creating files for archiving, especially if the archive includes JPEGs.

Installation on Two Computers
It is permissible to install the single license version of WinZip on two computers, as long as they are not used simultaneously.  The exact wording from the WinZip user agreement is:  ""If you have purchased a single-user license you have the right to install and use a single copy of WinZip on one computer or workstation for non-simultaneous use by one or more persons and install a second copy of WinZip on another computer or workstation for the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of WinZip.""

Interface
WinZip gives the option of using the Wizard or the Classic interface.  The Wizard is easy to use and takes the user through simple steps and questions to zip or unzip files.  The classic view includes many more options including 128- and 256-bit key password protection for the zipped files.  It is also possible to zip and unzip files by right clicking on the files in the Windows Explorer.

File Types
In addition to compressing files, WinZip opens and extracts content from the industry's widest selection of compressed file types, including Zip, Zipx, RAR, 7Z, BZ2, LHA, CAB, IMG, ISO, and most other file archive formats.

Email
Click on the mail button in the WinZip interface and WinZip will automatically open your default mail program (including Outlook and web based email such as Hotmail or Gmail).  In the case of Hotmail, I would have expected the first page which is opened to be the page for composing emails.  This is the case if you are already logged into Hotmail, but if you are not, the first page you see is the inbox.  I then had to close the browser page and click on email again in WinZip to start the message composition, but although the subject line of the message had the file name, I found that the file was not attached.  It may just be that WinZip and Hotmail using Internet Explorer do not play well together, but this was a bit disappointing.

Courier
WinZip 15 Standards includes a copy of Courier which automatically zips all files attached to an outgoing email. Courier is great if you regularly email compressed files or photos.  The supported email clients include Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Gmail and Hotmail.  When you attach files to an email, the standard dialogue box appears which allows you to choose the file to attach.  Courier adds to this window, controls to zip, encrypt or to resize photos which is a useful tool.  There is the option to make zipping files the default which would be useful if you send zipped files quite often, but annoying if you don't want to always zip files and forget that Courier will do this automatically.

Summary
If you don't currently own a compression utility and you would like to compress files for archiving, emailing or to save space on your computer, then you should definitely consider WinZip 15.  The Wizard interface makes zipping files easy for even novice users and the classic interface includes a lot of options for those who want more control of the process. However, if you are considering upgrading from a version of WinZip prior to version 12, you may want to reconsider unless you can take advantage of the compression of JPEG files using the zipx format.",0
"this street atlas is very good
it works great on both Vista and XP
Really like the price and the value

"A quick note. I do not work for MS. I have over 800 reviews to my name here unlike some with just 1 review.

We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again.",0
"I take a ton of pictures and sometimes you just want a quick click of the button to make a fix, and Photoshop can be a little daunting. This is where Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 can help out.

It's very easy to import pictures for organization. You can create albums, tags, etc. You can upload them to a cloud for safekeeping even.

I loved screwing around with the program the first time I sat down and played with it. It has your basic adjustments for tone, exposure, brightness, color, saturation, and lens correction.

 It also makes it easy to target certain sections of the photo for changes, fixes or deletion. For instance, if someone photo bombed you and you want to take them out of the picture, this program will help you do it. For those people who are not very Photoshop savvy, I'm telling you, it is EASY.

It's really fun playing with portraits because it has a whole beautification process you can put the photo through. You can adjust just about everything on the face, including eliminating wrinkles (yay for us who have surpassed the 40 year mark!) . You can adjust body shape, but, uh, no one would ever do that, right? hahaha. If you have a picture in which you look like Quasimodo, by the time you're done with it, you could be looking more like Cinderella.

And it really does so much more than that.

You can also make simple slideshows with your pictures and set them to music.

I did have one problem with this, but I'm sure I can find a resolution. My new computer doesn't have a disc drive and I didn't find a place to download the software online even though I have the software key. So I had to load it on my old computer. I'm sure there must be a place to do it, I probably just haven't found it yet. I'll keep searching, or if anyone knows where it is, a link would be helpful, hint hint...

Anyway, as you can probably tell, I sing the praises of this software. I've never been disappointed with Cyberlink before, having used their video software in the past as well. I think it's well worth the price and you will have a lot of fun with it and it won't make you want to pull your hair out.",0

"The year is nearly 2004 and I am still using Windows 2000. I used to be an NT 4 user but 2000 has to be the most solid Windows OS I have had the experience of using. Most software packages will still run under 2000 and so will new ones, even most games.
Windows 2000 is very secure and I use it mostly for hardcore multimedia work. I can count the amount of crashes I have had within almost 4 years using this OS on 1 hand! For the type of work that I do (Video, web, 3D) I need an OS that is going to be put through some intensive processes. 2000 did it for me.
Going with 2000 may not be the best choice for everybody, and XP is probably much better for the domestic home computer user, but if you want a solid system then look no further than 2000. It will not let you down.",0

"I started with Norton 360 which in turn  became this product. Though it does not due everything that I liked 360 for, once it is installed, you can stop worrying. That's what I truly value. I do use other products in addition, but this is my mainstay for protection from the outside.",0
"If version 4 was 3 stars, version 5 would deserve none.  There is no way to correct your mistakes.  It simply does not select dictated text to provide correction options and to learn from the mistakes.  That simple.  It really does not do a bad job at speech recognition itself and the provided vocabulary is of a really high quality.  However, its usability sucks big time because of its poor interface and usability issues.  It has tremendous potential otherwise.  Maybe the developers will get a clue by trying to use the software themselves.  If you would be happy to just dictate, ignore all of your mistakes and correct them at the end, then the current incarnation might serve you well (version 5.0.04, build 16361).  However, detecting the mistakes will not always be easy (spell checkers will not detect correctly spelled nonsense).",0

I have been using the product to create flyers and professional looking ads for awhile now, and I realize I am actually using only a small set of the features available with this software. I have also played with the photo editing/processing functions, and, while there are other software products designed for photo editing that are more comprehensive, the features available with this package have more than served my marketing needs. Everything, so far, has gone smooth--from installation of the software to using the different functions (I am running this using a Windows PC). I highly recommend this product if it fits your budget. What you can create by yourself may pay for the price of the product in the long run. Have fun!",0

"I'm a career techie.  Every year or so I buy this product, and every year or so I think about it before I buy it...then decide this is about as good as it gets.  The software almost never ""gets in the way"" of normal program adds, etc.  It reliably updates itself with fresh virus data just about all the time.

"So I got a new PC and it came with a few weeks free of McAfee AntiVirus Plus at a discount price.  I am a Norton guy on all my personal PCs.  Most of my work environments in the past have been McAfee because it is cheaper.  It was dog slow in the past, but I figured they would have got it right by now.  WRONG.  I was constantly turning off the active scan to speed up compiling and transferring files.

The product touted - This version of McAfee Internet Security was developed specifically to work with your Dell PC for maximum security, speed and seamless operation.

"This is my initial take on this edition of Cyber Link Photo Director 7 Ultra, to satisfy the needs required by Amazon Vine.

I have thus far only installed this on my Windows 8.1 laptop computer. I have a Windows 10 driven computer coming and will update the review upon installing it on that desktop. I also will install this on my Mac Mini, version 2011, as soon as I finish installing the new operating system upgrade.

At present, though, I am going to report my first impressions of my experience on the laptop.

Long ago, Adobe Photoshop leap-frogged me so badly that I am unable to justify the expenditure for their premier photo editing software. If I were seriously involved in publishing, though, I would be staying with them.

I have used their Photoshop Elements, though, and find it to be a good program for the hobbyist, as is Corel's version. Cyber Link's Photo Director 7 Ultra, though, seems to me to be a cut above the above alternatives, and worth every penny. Organizing the photographs is an item I am still playing with.

Bear in mind, I'm not interested in many features, such as editing out people or objects to make for a cleaner view. In that sense, I'm more of a purist, interested in improving upon the view, but not in so dressing up the picture to satisfy or stun my audience. What I mean is, I am more of a photo journalist than an artist.

At a future point I will describe the great features of the organizing feature, as well as it's weaknesses. Also, I will give the free mobile app a try, this week, and report on those results.

If you already have good photo editing software that you're happy with, this may still be a nice addition to your options. But, if you have no acceptable photo editing application, by all means, this is worth every penny, and works on Windows 10 very well. More on Macintosh later.",0

"Let me start by saying I am no way a professional photographer, but this software makes me feel like one. I take a lot of photo's of my grandson, and let me tell you, this software makes them look professional. I could upload all the pictures, and file them, then drag out the ones that I was to edit, but it saves my original pictures AND the ones that I have edited. This software loaded on my computer with no problems. It hasn't frozen up my computer yet. Which is a problem I have had in the past with other photo editing software. I will stick to this for a while.",0

It keeps track year by year (by importing last years form, from a saved Turbo Tax copy) on depreciation and prompts you for all deductions. You can't beat it. WalMart had the same program for $84. Amazon comes through again.",0

"I think I have about every version of PowerDVD ever produced.  The only version that ever gave me a problem was Version 12. I installed it on my Windows 8 based HP desktop computer and it would crash the operating system each and every time after I installed it.  I installed and uninstalled it about three times before I finally gave up. However, Version 13 installs and plays DVDs on the same Windows 8 HP computer without any issue.  So for at least my particular Windows 8 desktop computer, they fixed whatever the problem was with Version 12. PowerDVD claims their TrueTheater enhancements mean a sharper picture, enhanced lighting, and smoother motion - even on HD content. I use PowerDVD and my desktop computer instead of a dedicated Blu-ray player so that I can watch steaming movies on Netflix or archived movies on my bank of hard drives. I play everything through my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-STR-DA2400ES-7-1-Channel-Home-Theater-AV-Receiver/dp/B001CSCCGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony STR-DA2400ES 7.1 Channel Home Theater AV Receiver</a>&nbsp;for up-conversion and I can't detect much - if any - difference between a Blu-ray movie or a regular DVD on my Panasonic 65 inch plasma HDTV.

Cyberlink seems to come out with a new version of PowerDVD quite frequently. For my needs, all versions do about the same thing - play DVD movies on my computer. If you already own PowerDVD, I'm not sure it is financially worth it to upgrade unless there is some particular feature you can't live without.  But if you don't have any DVD playing software, then I most assuredly recommend that you purchase PowerDVD 13. I've tried the cheaper DVD player software, but they all fall way short of PowerDVD. I believe this newest version of PowerDVD will serve your needs well into the future.",0
"As a long time Quicken user, as well as a Beta tester, this is by far the best release in recent history.

I have been doing this manually but it is now a breeze with Quicken Premier 2015.

Also, if you haven't previously used the Quicken mobile app for tracking your spending with your mobile device, you will quickly learn to love this feature with the improvements in 2015.

This is by far the most stable Quicken I have tested and used and the improved interface makes it even easier to use.",0

The latest iteration of this suite is just as great. I am running it on a 7-year old Core Duo 2 with 2GB RAM (Win 7 x64), and it still runs like a champ without hogging my system's resources.

The old standby features are all still there - my favorite being Norton's File Insight which gives you a trust rating on downloaded files, Quick/Full scans, and the user interface retains the familiar tabbed-window look.

The new Backup feature also follows very familiar idioms for this category of software. You pick the What (files and folders), Where (the destination), and When (the frequency), and it does the rest.

Overall, this is a recommended upgrade to a software staple.",0

"Ok, it's a given that Win 10 is better than 8.1. It's a pretty good OS. It's also going to be supported for another 10 years. It's a real good bet that ""earlier"" Microsoft products will go end of life well before this does. It's also a good bet that as newer hardware comes out, you *will* need Win 10 to support it. All of the machines I have upgraded to Win 10 from 7 and 8.1 have done fine. I had one video driver on one of the 6 machines that needed to be updated (10 minute fix). That's pretty amazing for a Microsoft OS upgrade.

Right now, you have a couple of choices here on Amazon. You can grab this flash version of Win 10 and directly install it. No fuss, no problems it's a pretty easy thing to install. There are two other choices. You can buy either Win 8.1 or Win 7 disks and do the free upgrade. In both cases make sure you get the ""with SP1"" versions to reduce the hassles. You will need to do a *lot* of upgrades from Microsoft Update with either one. I've done both, the Win 7 process *seems* easier.

So what does this one do for you? It saves 1 or 2 days of poking at the computer every so often to tell it to do updates again. Could you do them faster than that? Sure, but you would need to sit at the machine for hours. If you are on a slow internet connection, it could take longer. If you are on Google Fiber at 1 Gb/s, can I come live at your house? All approaches get you a fully working Win 10 machine. Check the current prices (they change quickly). Right now you can save some real money going the Win 7 or 8.1 route. That *assumes* you have a DVD drive and don't need to hassle with converting a DVD to a flash stick for the install.

Since these reviews hang around for a while - This was written when Win 10 first came out. You have a year to go from Win 7 to Win 8.1 at this point. A year from now, doing a free upgrade from 7 or 8.1 probably isn't going to work.",0

What can you say great product.,0
"Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium version 13 is extremely similar to version 12 but has a lot of added extras, most of those are about the integration with Windows and the social media barrage of utilities.

 On a fresh install, you should be aware that you need.net 4.5 framework for Dragon NaturallySpeaking. After.net InstallShield has finished then the somewhat lengthy process of installing version 13 will occur (in my case, I put it on a laptop with a fairly high chipset, 12 gig of RAM, a secondary SSD drive and a moderately decent motherboard). It still took 90 minutes to complete. Anyway, in the early stages when the license agreement pops up you should read this, since some people may want to return the software.

  You will then be asked for the license key, and my suggestion is for you to choose custom set up. Custom set up gives you multiple options in English, and with most people, if they don't have a lexicon from the US, UK and other places, they will be perpetually corrected by the system. During the lengthy install, and it seems that it is long because the install process works out what the audio has for recording and playback, you will be constantly shown the basic tips and the learning center: from the point of view of someone new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking these two areas plus the quick start guide are the core points for using Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

If you have a version of Dragon, and have spent some time developing your profile, you should have it backed up. If not, you should do it as soon as possible. The handy part is that if you use version 12 and 13 like I do, you can use your profile and have it learning from where you were.
I use Dragon 12 at work and at home, so I have some level of comparison wih the versions in a personal and networked environment. You can't skimp on the system configuration, and if it looks like you might have to, then don't bother using Dragon. Dragon can control some windows functions, but thats not its prime purpose. Where I find it excels is when you have injuries, and I do, Dragon is a great tool. However, keeping your hard drive defragmented and optimized is essential. You can use Norton utils, or if you have issues ( technical issues) get a usb drive  of 8 to 16 gig, and install utils from portable apps dot com; portable apps defrag and optimize tools can basically save your setup, and it helps Dragon function. The biggest contrast I have is that my copy of Dragon at work uses a hard-drive that cannot be defragged because of the network, and the memory is garbage ( 2 gigs for Windows 7 is insane). Dragon is not as bad as some have said in performance, the reason that word shuts down on some computers with Dragon is that the PC has not been defragged and optimized ( by optimized I meand chkdsk with an F switch and other things; in most cases just run the app and click ""opimize"" from portable apps, it does work).

 The quick start guide is basically the main guide that you will initially be referring to, and for the most part it is unchanged from version 12. The elements you need to consider are what headsets you are going to use and in my opinion not use the one that comes with Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I chose KOSS CS-100 because of its noise reduction capabilities; if you don't have a headset with noise reduction capabilities the cyclical feedback will be a constant headache. Also, I would strongly suggest you do not use a broadband Bluetooth headset: this is not just a security suggestion, it is because the amount of people I know who have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and tried the Bluetooth headset, and they just gave up is very high.

This next suggestion is basically more than a suggestion: you will need to keep your hard drive as defragmented as you possibly can, and optimize the functions on Windows as best you can. If you use Dragon NaturallySpeaking on a network device, I know from experience that unless you have a group policy that frees up certain capabilities on your PC, you will have a very hard time using Dragon. The sum total of what happens on a PC is that the profile you use has to be as defragmented as possible, otherwise it will be shutting down about 50 to 60% of the time. The one thing I can say from experience is that when I first got Dragon, I had one arm that I could not use. The big problem is that you will need to use certain keyboard commands, so if you are using or planning to use Dragon with the hope of not doing any keyboard commands at all, then you may need to rethink your plans. You can macro certain things, but until Dragon gets used to your voice, and you get used to Dragon which in my experience can be from four weeks to three months, there is a learning curve.

It is an excellent tool, but the vowel sounds will catch you most of the time and certain conjunct consonants windup delivering some of the most absurd renderings of your speech: but the silly part about it is if you highlight the word or phrase that has come up looking absurd, the version you want is usually in the selection available. In my opinion is a handy tool, but it has its limitations.
  These are the quirks of the system, but once you get to know the short guide, it will allow you to use Dragon easily and quickly. Expect to do some editing; at least part of your verbal commands will be for editing, so you need to know that in advance.

  The claim is one of 99% accuracy but if you expect 93% as your peak, then you won't feel let down when you have to go through and do copious editing. It is very good and Dragon have a tool that is getting better and better since I first saw it around 2000, and the integration with Windows and various applications are getting better and better. Overall if you do want a version of Dragon that operates better, check out the one for Mac, which in my opinion is a lot better, but still this version for PC is still very good.",0

"I wanted to give plenty of time to explore the many features of Norton 360. Having used the Norton Security Suite, I wanted to see how well the extra features would work. Norton 360 installs fast and the default settings provide you with a secured PC. You don't have to do much tweaking, but you should check out the many options available. Norton 360 provides virus, spyware and firewall features for PC Security, Identity Protection for online banking and shopping (with an identity safe as well for secure logins),Backup features with 2GB of included online storage, (more space is available at extra cost), and PC tuneup features including disk optimization, file optimization, diagnostic scans, a startup manager to shut off non-necessary programs that can slow your system down and a registry cleanup to fix bad entries in your Windows Registry. The PC tune up features were the real draw for this set, which sets it apart from the regular security suite. It also has rootkit and botnet protection to keep your PC safe from these attacks. I will break this into the four sections to make it easier to comment on the features.

PC Security
Norton takes care of updating automatically, though you can run Liveupdate manually if you choose. The frequent updates take little time, but keep your PC protected and you don't have to reboot very much. You can run scan options for comprehensive (longer) and quick (shorter) time frames. If your PC is idle, Norton will automatically do a comprehensive background scan and fix any issues automatically. The option to delete temp files and browsing history are also available with the comprehensive scans. I recommend running a quick scan after browsing the net and running a comprehensive one at least once a week. While updates keep your PC updated, it is important for you to run frequent scans to look for things that may not be caught by a quick scan alone.

Identity Protection
Norton will ""learn"" your browsing habits to configure options for banking and shopping sites. If you choose to use the Identity Safe, you will need to provide a password for secure logins. I use the excellent Roboform for login and password protection, so I did not use their Identity safe.

Backup
Backup is included with 2GB of online storage with more storage available for a nominal cost. Setup is easy. You should check your options to keep space within the provided limit unless you have opted for more storage. The easy walk through will show you how much your system and update everytime you change a location feature (selecting documents, music, pictures, etc). Once set up, Backup will remind you to take the time to backup your important files. The first time will be a bit long, but subsequent backups will go quickly. If you don't backup for several weeks, Norton will not allow you to run a scan will backup first. This is a great reminder for people who don't make backups a part of their computing experience. You can also restore files. This was much easier to use than I expected.

PC Tuneup
The PC Tuneup section is great. It will cleanup your temp files, Internet Explorer history and run scans to check PC health and fix errors. The disk optimization also includes disk degfragging. I don't run the disk defragger since I use the excellent Diskeeper program wich provides more advanced defrag options, such as boot-time, page file and master file table defragging, checkdisk options and constant system defraggs. (Yes girls can be geeks too!)The registry cleanup is easy to use. The Windows Registry is heart of your PC and all programs write to this location. The Registry IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS or those unfamiliar with software programming. Messing with the Registry CAN DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER. Fortunately, a number of great programs can fix errors which can slow your PC with a simple scan. Norton's Registry cleaner does a great job, simply click to run a scan and it takes care of the issues for you.

All options are available in easy to use Windows and have clear selections to view tasks or settings. You won't need to visit these often, as Norton takes good care of your PC without much input for you. While it does, it is important for you to take the time to actually run some of the scans and take a proactive stance to keep yourself safe. I highly recommend Norton 360, powerful and easy to use tools and protection for your PC.",0

I never saw that before.  Then I saw a bunch of attack screens pop up.  I'm like, seriously?  You just did that because you saw the Norton in my pocket.

Before I could install this, I had to update my OS X.  I have been ignoring, or doing my best to ignore 10.7 Lion.  I can fly with 10.6 and sometimes these upgrades seem gratuitous, especially with all the problems this one reportedly caused.  But it was worse than that because Apple wouldn't let me go up one step.  The word I am thinking of starts with a B, has 8 letters, and rhymes with astards.  I had to go up to 10.8.

Then finally, I was able to start the Norton Internet Security. Something that should have taken five minutes took over an hour.  Why is it that I have so much difficulty doing simple things?  I had done the upgrade to 10.8, against my will, but nevertheless.  This should have been a breeze.  This is NORTON!

The first error was that I could not run a scan because the program I JUST installed could not load the scan engine because it needed to be updated.  REALLY?  I just updated it.  THREE minutes ago.  Neither could I slide the simple on button of virus protection.  I just got error readings that told me I needed to do a Live Update that wouldn't run because I JUST did it.

I have 91 messages like this pending:

Norton AntiVirusError
AntiVirus Auto-Protect could not load the scan engine.
Please run LiveUpdate to get the latest version.

I know that it is faster for Rajesh and all his counterparts to use a remote control on my computer to get it to work and my degree of frustration had me let him.  I LOLed very loudly when I saw the same things happened to him for awhile.  He finally just deleted everything Norton from my computer and reinstalled it.  He was very polite but my computer still had to be invaded to get this program to work.

It should be easier.  I want to be able to think: Yes, put this on my computer and have it be done.",0
"Ive used Turbo Tax for the 3 previous years & will use it this year as well. I don't have alot of deductions, or any children & Im single but I 'aint' the sharpest knife in the drawer & Im kinda math stupid. So in the past Ive always be a little apprehensive when I mail my returns.

I also moved 3 years ago from a state with no state taxes to a state that does collect taxes. Alot of taxes! That along with the fact that Im making more money (curse this G.W.Bush economy!) & have a larger 401K, a substantial high interest savings account & a another investment on the side, I feel the need to get the most I can out of my taxes & reporting of same.

My taxes are fairly straight forward ( I think!? ) & with some effort I could go back to doing them again. But I have made mistakes doing my taxes  in the past & Turbo Tax ( so far ) has not. I feel confidant using Turbo Tax & that alone is worth the price of admission.

As far as the e filing, I don't use it. Thankfully, Im in a position where I can wait for my check. If I got it right away it wouldnt make any difference in my quality of life so the expense is just a waste for me.

"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
For those who are using Windows XP: There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it. Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"For those who very occasionally run across a zip file and need to open it, WinZip 14 likely isn't worthwhile.  Ever since Windows XP, after all, Microsoft has included a built in zip manager.  The trouble is that while this basic zip management exists, it really is not all that good.  It opens and it makes zip files.

For those who deal with lots of files and find that compressing and combining files into zip folders is a regular task, I heartily recommend WinZip 14.  It is very easy to use, and provides significantly more compression than other programs I have used. It also offers much better security options, and overall has made my file management tasks and emailing significantly easier.

This is a program that works, works easily, and works better than anything else I have found.  Definitely worth the small amount of money.",0

"Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon... I would definitely recommend you purchase this interactive mystery PC game!!  The graphics are vibrant; the sound effects are very good and add a key element to your game play; the characters are interesting; the clues keep you thinking and looking for answers; and Nancy will not let you down!  She is not afraid to hunt wherever she must!  The train ride seems realistic, as you pass from one car to the next.  You get to use a cell phone camera at some point.  One reviewer said it's too short, however, my experience (as an adult) is that it is just the right length, especially for a $20 game.  I don't try to race through the game, rather I save it and then go back.  It's up to you.  And it is still fun to play the game again, even after you've solved it.

"I've used Partition Magic since version 3.0. Partition Magic 7.0 is now WinXP compatable and supports hard drives up to 80 GB.

I have a PC-DOS/Win3.1 partition and a Win98SE partition on the same hard drive and a WixXP partition (preview version) on a second hard drive. I have also had a Linux partition on the first drive. You can resize partitions and convert from fat 16 to fat32 and back. You can also divide one large hard drive into several drives to help organize data and files.

"I have used both Painter 11 and Painter 12 and find these more intuitive to use than Painter Essentials 5, which is essentially a stripped-down version of the full-fledged Painter programs. Painter 11 and 12 have more brushes, more canvas textures, wet background painting, more options and customizations, and a slew of other niceties that Painter Essentials lack. HOWEVER, Painter is also more than 10 times the price of Painter Essentials. PLUS, Painter 11 and 12 are buggy and computer resource intensive. Painter Essentials, on the other hand, is easy on the CPU, has a much smaller memory footprint, is less buggy, and plays very well with Windows 10.

If you're not a graphic artist and simply want to try your hand at digital painting or to use the (very nifty) auto-painting feature, which transforms your photos into very convincing works of art, Painter Essentials is a good way to go. If you can't decide which program is right for you, Corel offers free trials of both programs (direct links provided in the comments section).

I personally like Painter Essentials 5 and think it is very good for what it is. Definitely recommended for the semi-serious digital artist.",0

"I've used a lot of anti-virus through the years but I keep coming back to McAfee.  Honestly no virus protection is perfect, they each have their advantages, but the depth of McAfee's product just outstrips the others in the end.  At the end of the day being able to afford the biggest anti-virus teams gives them a leg up on the competition.  You simply get your alerts faster, and if you get into trouble, they can get you out.  My Dad once fell for a Malware site and a McAfee tech spent three hours on the phone with him undoing the damage.  You can't beat that kind of support.

It used to be you could say a lot about interfaces, but frankly all the major vendors have done a good job of improving their interface and I don't have any complaints about any of them.  McAfee is no exception: the interface is easy to use for a novice but there are lots of nobs in there for experts to play with.

One future selling point: now that Intel owns McAfee they will be enabling special security features that use Intel hardware.  This is something that was never possible before, because hardware vendors didn't want to give software that low-level control, and software vendors didn't want to share their code.  Now that it's all under one roof, the capabilities look to be amazing.",0

"""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" is here! The follow-up of ""The Final Scene"" continues to offer some great gaming with complex puzzles, intense plots, and some cool characters. While I prefer the previous three games, ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" is a good game, and among the most important games in the series.

Nancy has decided to take a break and head out for an internship at Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C. Her dad's friend, Franklin Rose, has spoken with the Board of Directors to set this up for her, and she'll be working with several other experts of Mayan culture to set up Beech Hill's new exhibit, featuring a jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal and ancient monolith that was recently excavated from Mexico. While Nancy's internship starts off peaceful, Beech Hill soon becomes victim of a burglary! After the theft, Nancy finds a piece of paper with a gruesome scarlet hand left in the place of the now-missing Pacal carving. While investigating, she learns that a series of similar thefts have occurred around the country. Nancy's now determined to retrieve the carving and catch this thief red-handed.

The setting was great, and unlike any that's been seen in a Nancy Drew game before (or since). While there is more limited exploration, the areas that were able to be explored were nicely decorated and fully-interactive. I liked walking through the temple of Maya games and playing them all, as well as exploring other areas in Washington D.C. The abundant exploration that was in the previous three installments is definitely lacking here, though. There were several locations that didn't serve much of a purpose in the game (save to talk with a specific suspect) and the museum lacked any secret passageways. Regardless, the places that the suspects are conversed with are very nicely detailed and I rather enjoyed seeing different areas and buildings in Washington, D.C. while living vicariously through Nancy.

Some of the chores were rather tedious, such as matching up an exhibit with its correct recording. However, chores like these were the exception instead of the rule. Most of the games were rather entertaining, especially the maze and ancient Mayan games.

The suspects are probably the most disappointing aspect in this game. They include the museum curator, Joanna Riggs, Henrik Van Der Hume, the artifact expert, Alejandro del Rio, the attach to the Mexican Consulate, and Taylor Sinclair, the art dealer who helped Joanna get her hands on several of the artifacts that will soon be put on display. As a whole, the suspects are rather flat and unable to be conversed with much. Joanna is especially guilty of this, as her character definitely borders on useless. Most questions Nancy asks her, she answers with something along the lines of ""Henrik can help you with that."" Taylor and Alejandro are hardly much better when it comes to development, only serving to be conversed with once every so often and not providing much insight into the case. On the contrary, Henrik was awesome and nicely developed, and he winds up playing a very large role in the game itself.

While three of the four suspects weren't very developed, they all did have some great motives to be the culprit in the end. Even though I didn't see this culprit coming when I first played the game, I see in hindsight that he/she is truly the most logical choice. This is definitely another game in which I cannot see anybody but the guilty party as the culprit in the end.

As stated before, the suspects weren't very nicely integrated. The phone friends, on the other hand, were very well scripted and employed. I loved all of the conversations that Nancy has on the phone with people, as they were humorously and cleverly composed. Most importantly, several characters that play important roles in the Nancy Drew series as a whole make their first appearance in this game, including Frank and Joe Hardy (AKA The Hardy Boys), Poppy Dada, Prudence Rutherford, and Sonny Joon. This is also the first game to feature the name of the Krolmeister company, which will play a substantial role in the games to come.

The music was definitely different when compared to other games, in that it has more of a ""historical"" and ""nature"" feel to it, while the soundtracks of other games were more ""mysterious"" and ""elegant"". This, however, is a bonus for this game. While previous games have focused on bandits, royalty, and magicians, this game focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization. The soundtrack was great for a museum filled with the histories of these ancient people, and all the tracks certainly felt in place.

Is ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" my favorite Nancy Drew game of all time? No. Does it rank high on the list, though? Most definitely. While I did prefer the previous three games, this one certainly holds up to the high standards that the Nancy Drew series has set for itself. The plot is wonderful, and ultimately leads to an unforgettable and heart-pounding encounter that I never saw coming. Certainly can't wait to write about the next game all because of this one! :)",0
"I'm a long-time fan of Ancestry.com and their products, and this was not a let down. They have an extensive depth to their products, and allow you to create a wonderful history that you can easily share with others. This is not something that you need to buy ever year, even though they put one out every year. The updates they have done since last year's release aren't that substantial that it warrants paying the money for. But every other year or few years, yes. Better editing and searching capabilities, and general fine-tuning make it worth it at that point.

If you're not familiar with the products, FTM offers your standard build-a-tree and supplies the capability to enter in a large amount of data. It can handle upwards of 2,500 names, allows for records and pictures to be associated with one or several people, and even states the relation between you and the person you are looking at or editing. You can sync the software and the online information easily, but I prefer to leave my separate. I use the free trial that comes with the software to gather as much data as I can. If I even smell something that might be a hint, I grab it up. Once my time is over, I use it to sort through things. If I come across something I need to investigate further, I purchase individual records where I can, or make note of it for the next time I buy it.

If you are looking to get into genealogy, this is a great way to get started. I highly recommend any of the FTM products. They have great support, the members are friendly, and you'll have cousins coming out of the woodwork!",0
"Please see [...] for a comparison of the features in pre-ribbon versions of Word to WordPerfect.  It is enlightening!

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3. When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel. Based on the $150 difference in price between this version and the student/home version, I would seriously consider the student version.  It is my understanding that it is very similar, if not the same.  The Student/Home version apparently lacks the PDF capabilities of the Standard and Pro versions, so if you need those capabilities, buy this version.  (I would check with with Corel to be certain if all the features are present.)

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal. It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version. It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document. Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7. It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window. This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4. I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use. If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!
One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.
As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

Other Programs:

The Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office. The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning. I haven't yet figured out what Lightning does except act as a notebook of some sort.",0
"I have owned the NV+ and this NVX is much better, read much faster.  It validated all the new disks I bought and said two of them were bad even though they worked in a PC.  It is very quiet and does not take much power.  Software is very versatile - lot of options and the web interface is very straight forward.  5 year warranty is also appreciated.",0
"WinZip 18 is the latest version of the popular zip and compression software from Corel. While there are many free and shareware options available, they aren't always compatible with many systems. 7-Zip, a popular option was used by my company. I had to stop using it because everyone I sent zip files to could not open or read anything compressed with 7-Zip even though many had the program installed on their computers. We never had this problem using WinZip. It is a standard that does work well with virtually any program. I didn't see a large amount of difference between version 17 as opposed to version 18. It is still fast and efficient. I do love the integration with the cloud services. WinZip will zip to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive (formerly Skydrive from Microsoft), Box, SugarSync and CloudMe. It will also zip to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It also will encrypt your files for protection. The Cloud navigation has been improved, though it was always easy for me to access my Cloud zips before. You can also send links to you zip files in the Cloud if you need to share them. I also love the fact that you can create PDF files from WinZip and add watermarks. That is a great option if you don't have a PDF creator available. You can also create self-extracting zip files for those who don't have a zip program. It handles the usual RAR, 7-Zip, BZ2 and many others. When extracting encrypted files WinZip does auto wipe the temporary files for protection One new feature are the WinZip Express Add-Ons. The new Add-Ons are available for Windows Explorer (in Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows 8 has replaced Explorer with OneDrive), photos, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint (Enterprise option for work) and photos. As is normal for Corel, only the Add-On for Explorer is free to registered users of WinZip 18. The other options are $12.95 with a discount for registered users of $9.95 at the time of this writing. Although I find WinZip to be the best service for zipping, compressing and encrypting files that I have used, Corel charges for everything now, upgrades to Pro, extra charges for the Add-Ons. I am certain these were separated because inclusion would have made the program more costly and everyone does not need as many features. WinZip has also ballooned to include a wide variety of services besides the base product and you will hear about those after you register your email address (required). It is still the best overall for regular consumers and the easiest to use that works with nearly everything. I still highly recommend it since I have tried several other compressions that are too complicated to use and/or others were not able to read the compressed files. Zipping, compressing and encryption do word much faster and easier with WinZip.",0
"I've recently switched from McAfee, after far too many unhappy experiences and have think I found my new PC security software company: Kaspersky.  Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 is a very capable program, but pales in comparison to their fully featured version called Kaspersky Pure.

Both software offerings from Kaspersky are great.  It's just that Pure offers much more.",0

"Year after year, Norton provides very solid protection from online threats.  One feature that stands out is that is it very unintrusive:  You simply install it and pretty much forget it and let it work in the background.  This is very ideal to install for someone who isn't a computer expert, thus taking away most of the decision-making away from their fingertips.  It is barely a resource hog, although with the powerful machines these days, the days of anti-viruses slowing down your PCs are long over, unless you are still running an ancient system.

You no longer get a disc--You only get a code in the box!  Which makes sense because most of the time when you get a CD to install, chances are its already outdated and you have to install an update out of the gate.  This also keeps the environment cleaner.  Although why not just e-mail the code and not send me the box at this point?  You should also register this product on their website, just in case you need to re-install the CD, as the serial key is already stored there as well.

"To be honest, I had never even heard of Avira Internet Security, but seeing I had an opportunity to give it a whirl, I decided to give it a try.

I was surprised just how easily everything went. The installation was a breeze for me, I've had problems with other programs in the past during installation.

"After my mother clicked on something she shouldn't have and unleashed the bugs, I had her run Malwarebytes (free) on her PC. She couldn't do anything with her computer without a pop-up coming up for something she didn't want or her mouse intermittently becoming unresponsive prior to running that scan and cleaning out the malware files. That free program picked up 645 issues, but I felt like she needed something more so I bought this Premium version.

This version works quietly in the background and can be installed on up to 3 PCs with a 1 year subscription. Setting the schedule to automatically update the program is something that is done when the product is installed.

I suggest going into Settings, then Automated Scheduling to Edit the automatically set times. For me those were set to times when I've powered down my PC. I would also suggest adjusting for two scans a day (6 hours apart) versus one a day. The scans don't tax the PC's resources so they should run quietly int he background.

I like that this program adds an effective layer of protection to my PC. It's user-friendly and works as expected. Along with an antivirus program, it offers great security and peace of mind. Highly recommend it!",0

"Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 13 is a useful and flexible tool for those who take the time to setup and train it. I recently helped my brother setup Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  12 a while after he purchased it. I'll focus on the differences between the two.

With both installation on Windows 7 Pro was painless. The initial setup of 12 wanted you to do the training step which involves reading several pages from a publication. These are internal to the Dragon setup with several good selections. With 13 much of this is optional, but still improves accuracy and helps Dragon learn you writing style.

Dragon profile setup may be tedious, but I think it's worth it for the improved results.

In Dragon 13 literature there are 14 new or improved features:
1) 15% greater accuracy: I'm not sure how such a definitive number, but I believe it's improved.

2) Learning from sent email works with web clients now:
  I don't use the supported web mail clients - I'm an Outlook gal.

3) There is a new Dragon Vocabulary editor:
  I have not tried this yet. I'll share my experience when I update this again later.

4) Smart Format Rules Enhancement:
  I think 13 is learning my common usage and adapting. This is kind of subtle and I can't really tell yet if it's better than 12.

5) Faster Than Ever:
  13 does seem a little faster to me but it's hard to tell on different machines with different characteristics. My brother's PC with 12 is an older core duo and has 6GB. Mine is a newer core i7 with 16GB. It seems fast enough to me. 13 is supposed to evaluate the resources of a system and adapt Dragon to make the best use of even limited resources.

Easier setup is via several changes in requirements and the audio setup. All to remove or make optional steps that were included in the Dragon 12 setup. This makes it faster to get started but all three of these improve quality.

6) With 13 Dragon assigns a name to profiles:
  To name a profile you need to rename it later. In 12 you were asked for the name when creating the profile.

7) The somewhat tedious reading for 4 minutes isn't required any more:
  It does improve accuracy. My vision impaired brother struggled with reading the selection from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it took us nearly an hour to get through it. When we were done Dragon did very well with his distinct ""Down East"" Maine accent. While it's not required in 13 I think it made a noticeable improvement.

8) Dragon 13 no longer asks to adapt its vocabulary with documents/email at profile creation:
  This saves time but, again it is a step that benefits overall use at a less convenient startup. Document/email analysis can be done later.

9) Dragon 13 audio setup lets you just pick your input device:
  I used the headset that came with Dragon Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  which works very well. 13 also works pretty well with my laptop's built-in noise cancelling microphone which 12 didn't support. I don't even recall the microphone setup steps on 12 so I think they must have been almost as easy. I'm happy to see support for the open source OpenOffice Writer V4.1.

10) The microphone check step is a short reading:
  Again I don't recall this step on 12 though I'm sure it was there too.

11) Dragon 13 has increased its support of web based applications:
  Support has been added for web applications like Gmail and added commands and support for all major browsers. I have not explored this too much yet. I'll update this review when I've learned more. Dragon is very impressive to me in the amount of voice control it readily provides.

12) The DragonBar has been redesigned in 13:
  If you have 12 and want to go back to the ""classic"" bar it's in there and supported. I like the way it autocollapses so it does not use more screen space than needed.

13) The Dragon Sidebar is now the Learning Center:
  Whatever they call it I like having it around as I am continuing to learn Dragon. They way it adapts to the context of the currently open application is clever and very helpful.

14) The interactive tutorial has been expanded:
  It now covers the Dragon bar, learning center and the Vocabulary Editor. I think the tutorials are pretty good, but I just jumped in head first. In 12 my brother tried the tutorial simulation. It was well intentioned but the tutorial didn't understand his accent. Seems the tutorials do not use the just created profile. They are there for those who want/need them and that's a very good thing.

So far I'm liking Dragon 13 with the included headset. It's a complex program with many aspects I hope to try and dig into as I find time to get beyond my present basic use. These include using the dictation transcription capability which I hope to use with the iPhone app.

Dragon isn't perfect - sometimes it can seem to get confused when I stumble over some words, and this can result in dictated text that is hilarious! When this happens and I try to continue while laughing the results can get even more funny to the point where I have to stop and walk away and regain my composure before continuing. Somehow I've come to really like those fairly rare times takes me into a laughing fit. I can't think of another program where I look forward to it going off the rails like this.

It seems to me that 13 appears more an incremental improvement over 12 than a revolutionary upgrade. If I had 12 instead of my brother I would probably just kept it. If you need the expanded applications control or need more flexible microphone capability then 13 may be a good move even from 12.

Because it's the standard at what it does and I've had no problems with it I'm giving  Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  13 Five stars.",0

"I bought Office 2010 for several reasons.
1. It is used by and for work, where they use Office 2007 on computers and 365 on the web.. Compatibility with my Open Office was not good. I could not open or edit without many work-arounds from my work e-mail. Sometimes not at all.
2. 2010 is the last of the ""Buy it for your computers (3 pc's) and Use it at home versions""
3 The price can't be beat. AND I have the disk!

  The install was quick on 2 Windows 8 Pro (64bit) computers and one Windows 7 Home (64bit) Laptop. About 15 minutes each plus time for 38 updates and re-boots.

Cons: My fault... I had trouble opening excel from company e-mails. A box kept popping up that it had a ""problem sending the command to program"" I had to save to desktop then search for it to open. It worked on my wife's computer just fine, but not mine (?)
  The fix: open the ""C"" drive, Programs (X86) go to Microsoft Office then Office 14 look for EXCEL (which is listed as an application). Right click to properties click compatibility  and uncheck ""run as administrator"" and uncheck run in ""compatibility mode"".  at the bottom click ""change for all users"" and close.
  Now..against advice, I put MY computer in ""run in Win 7"" compatibility mode"" because that what we use at work. And ""BINGO"" Now it works great. On my wife's computer I un-checked run in compatibility mode. and it also works great.
 So the main problem was ""run as administrator""  was checked on mine.

Final thoughts: I love it. Works great. If I were you I would buy it.

"I am using Norton Ghost on my Windows Vista machine with an external Seagate Hard Drive. Ghost is very easy to setup, and it walks you through doing a backup, so even the newbie pc users can backup their files easily. My initial concern was being able to search through the backups for a specific file but they have made that very simple and really fast in my opinion. As a seasoned IT guy, I didn't know if Ghost was really for me since I used to think of it more in terms with ""imaging"". However, Ghost 12 is the best solution I found for day to day backup of my home and business computers. You can setup automated backups so that every week, day, Monday, etc... the system will automatically do a backup without user intervention. I have tested the restore methods, and not only are they reliable, but they are fast too. In case you try to restore a file that already exists, you will be prompted by Windows to confirm the restore, which should help prevent overwriting a good file by accident. I hope every computer user will seriously consider getting an external storage device and using a backup utility like Ghost to safeguard their entire system or at least their important files.",0

"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure.

Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.",0
"I got this for my 5 yr. old grandson, who is in kindergarten right now. He is just learning letters and their sounds. He is also learning to put the letters together and make small words. When I put this in the computer, I had to guide him through some of the things, but with others, he got it right away.

There are so many levels and games, that he hasn't even gotten through half of them yet, but he is really learning a lot. There are 10 levels, and so many activities, that this will keep him busy for years to come. He is the kind of kid that learns by listening, and is a hands on kind of kid. He loves this program, and now every time he comes to my house, he runs right to the computer and wants to play. That alone is worth the cost. I highly recommend this program for children, so they can get a jump on what they are learning in school.",0

"Since I got my first computer I have used so many types Security packages, including the free ones.  This is simple to install and runs in the background I have not noticed it slowing down the computer and I have  installed it on Vista and Windows 7.  It found some minor infections other programs failed to percieve, so this made me glad I used it.  This is so much better than ones I have used in the past--especially on Vista, which is a bloared system and has no trouble getting hung up w/o the help of an added security system",0
I bought this item a week ago to share the printer on two machines. There is no problem in setting up this network server. I have an old hp office jet printer which has parallel port; I connect printer to usb 4 hub by cable which has on one end IEEE connector go to printer and other end is usb which is connected to usb 4 hub and hub is connected to arkview server. Software of arkview easily recognize the printer. I attached other usb flash drive. It recognize it too. I installed server on two computers. It is working good.,0
"Three of the members of my family have been using this program for the past two - three weeks.  The first is myself, a 40 something who took Spanish in high school for 3 years, spent a summer in South America (and emerged fluent from that experience) but now am quite rusty.  I still understand a great deal of Spanish, but have lost my ability to speak it.  The second is my 12 year old son, who has had one year of fairly intensive Spanish over the previous school year.  The third is my 9 year old daughter, her previous Spanish only a few words gleaned from Dora the Explorer.

Both of my kids have to earn TV or video game time over the summer.  They  earn it by reading or playing educational computer games.  I offered this program as a choice when it arrived and both have chosen to do Rosetta Stone for about 80% of the overall required time.  Obviously they enjoy it, but would not chose it over playing on the video game console.

 Both kids have been using the microphone.  I feel this is a strong point of the program since my kids really do not hear native speakers with the other Spanish Language Program we have (Eazyspeak Spanish ) .  The microphone option has several choices for how closely you have to match the correct pronunciation in order to ""pass"".  I have it adjusted higher for my son and lower for my daughter.  I also had to adjust the speaker volume from the control panel of the computer (use Start- Control Panel - Sounds and Audio Devices).  For the 12 year old with one year of Spanish, starting about halfway though level one was appropriate.

For myself Level 1 was too easy.  At level 2 I found that I was ""relearning"" some things (especially matching noun and verb type) that I had forgotten.  The program is visually pleasant,  good quality photos, and a good mix of types of teaching such as listening to a phrase and picking the correct photo,  repeating phrases,  having to come up with your own phrases to describe the photos,  typing answers.

I find the audio companion very useful, it is helping me drag the forgotten Spanish out of my brain.  The kids do not like it at all,  I think the lack of visual feedback is frustrating for them but it could also be that they prefer the ""books on cd"" we usually listen to when traveling in the car.

My son had been using ""Eazyspeak Spanish"" before Rosetta stone.  This is also a good program for learning basic vocabulary (if you just want to go to Mexico and be able to ask for the bathroom, or chose menu items) but it does not give you any feedback about your pronunciation.  Be aware, the Eazyspeak  program does teach all sorts of names for alcoholic drinks and has some innuendos.

Rosetta Stone is a great way to learn basic Spanish, much closer to how you ""naturally"" learn. However, I do not thing you will be ""fluent"" after finishing the program, but you will be able to get your basic messages across and navigate more easily when on vacation.

It is fantastic as a supplement to a beginning Spanish classes and a great way for kids to start learning another language.  I plan on having my daughter finish all the lessons before she starts taking Spanish in school, it should give her a good solid foundation.

***UPDATE

My son went back to school 3 weeks ago.  I got an email from his teacher this week saying that my son had really improved his pronunciation over the summer and had remembered more of his vocabulary than the rest of the class.  He asked me if what we did with him over the summer and I told him that my son had done Eazy Speak Spanish for a month and then Rosetta Stone.

**One year update

 We are still using this software on a weekly basis.  During the summer I have my teenage son (who is taking Spanish in school) use Rosetta Stone.  It is very helpful in retaining vocabulary.  My 10 year old daughter has been working her way through the program as well,  she should start out her first Spanish class with a good grasp of some of the basics.  They enjoy the program, so it does not take much pushing to get them to use it.",0

"Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.",0

"Two years ago, I upgraded to PowerDVD 14 Ultra. Because PowerDVD 14 Ultra did not support FLAC audio, I still often used the VLC media player to play content that has FLAC audio. And to play ISO images on disk, I use Daemon Tools to mount ISO files to virtual drives that both PowerDVD 14 and VLC could then play. The free VLC media player also starts up a lot quicker than PowerDVD if I just wanted to quickly view something. Support for FLAC audio and the ability to play ISO images were both added to PowerDVD 15, along with a PowerDVD Remote app that lets you use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a remote control. PowerDVD 16 Ultra's two main improvements to PowerDVD 15 Ultra are: (1) a new ""TV Mode"", which I do not find that much more useful than the usual ""PC Mode"", and (2) some YouTube features such as the ability to download YouTube videos to play offline and the ability to upscale YouTube videos to HD quality, and the ability to watch Vimeo videos.

I was initially excited about the new YouTube features that were introduced in this version 16.  However, the new YouTube options are VERY buggy :-( In trying to play various YouTube videos in PowerDVD 16 Ultra, the software would either tell me that the video cannot be played and it just provided a link for me to play the video using the Web browser, or the PowerDVD busy-icon would continue to spin forever until I clicked the [Stop] button to end the attempt at playing the YouTube video and I had to use the Web browser to view that video on the YouTube site.  But for the online videos that PowerDVD is able to play, I am then able to use its TrueTheater audio and video enhancement options.  I often turn off the TrueTheater function when playing Blu-ray discs.  But YouTube videos often have mediocre video or audio quality, and so I find the TrueTheater enhancements to be very useful for playing online videos.

With many YouTube videos, PowerDVD only offers a subset of resolution qualities.  For example, I often encountered YouTube videos where PowerDVD only gave me the option to play it at two or three resolutions, such as 360P or 720P quality.  But if I play the same video using my Web browser on the YouTube site, I get the full spectrum of 144P, 240P, 360P, 480P, 720P, and 1080P quality options.  I would not mind PowerDVD leaving out some of the lower resolutions, but it should at least offer to play the video at the highest resolution that YouTube offers.  But instead it sometimes would not include the 1080P and/or 720P options that YouTube offers for the video, whereas playing the same video from the Web browser gives me all of those quality options.

The new feature to ""download YouTube videos to play offline"" is partially useful.  The software downloads the YouTube video to its own cache directory in a proprietary format.  So if you were hoping that PowerDVD 16 Ultra can now download YouTube videos as portable AVI or MP4 video files, it does not do this.  There are various Web sites that let you perform online conversion and download of AVI or MP4 files from YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sources.

In order to play ISO images, PowerDVD 16 first needs to install a device driver that creates a virtual drive.  On two ISO images, I found a weird bug where the video would play, but the audio was entirely missing.  But if I mount these same two ISO files using Daemon Tools Lite and then play the ISO image on the virtual drive that Daemon Tools Lite created, PowerDVD 16 then plays the audio normally.  So if you are not getting any audio from an ISO image being played by PowerDVD 16, try mounting the ISO file using Daemon Tools first, and then using PowerDVD 16 to play the ISO image mounted on the Daemon Tools' virtual drive, instead of directly playing the ISO image using PowerDVD 16.  If you plan to frequently play various ISO images during a single viewing session, it is faster to use Daemon Tools to mount the ISO images.  PowerDVD 16 takes awhile to mount each ISO image before it can play the ISO file.  You see its busy-icon spinning on the screen while it creates a virtual drive to mount the ISO image.  When you click the [Stop] button, the ISO image is unmounted and the virtual drive is removed.  And then when you play a different ISO file, you have to wait again while it creates a new virtual drive.  This delay is okay if you are just playing one ISO file.  But if you want to play multiple ISO files in a quick sequence, it is quicker to start up Daemon Tools and use it to mount each ISO file before playing the files in PowerDVD by accessing the virtual drives created by Daemon Tools.  I think PowerDVD's handling of ISO images would have fewer delays if it did not remove its virtual drive after the playback of each ISO image is stopped.  Ideally, after the first ISO image is played, the PowerDVD virtual drive should be retained for further use with other ISO files and only removed when PowerDVD is exited.

PowerDVD 16 is advertised for use with Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10.  But I have also been using it on Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) for several weeks now with no problems.  It seems more stable than the previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra that I was using.  PowerDVD 14 Ultra would sometimes crash my computer with the Windows ""Blue Screen Of Death"", but I have not yet experienced a BSOD crash using PowerDVD Ultra 16.

Compared with PowerDVD 14, this version 16 is also far more well-behaved and polished in all areas.  After I installed PowerDVD 14 Ultra two years ago, I discovered that its installation routine quietly changed every file type association to default to PowerDVD, including all video, music, and image file types.  Other software like WinRAR and VLC Media Player politely ask if you want to associate various file types to default to being used by their software, and they let you click or unclick the file types that you want to associate or dissociate with the program.  Now PowerDVD 16's installation process also lets you select which file types to associate with the software, instead of forcing itself onto every file type.  PowerDVD 16 also has subtle improvements in remembering where you last played a video and the folder that you accessed last.

With my previous PowerDVD 14 version, every time that I closed the program, it would always still leave between one and five different processes running in the background that serve no purpose other than to consume memory.  With this PowerDVD 16 Ultra, closing the program usually cleanly ends five of the processes used by the program: clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, PowerDVD.exe, PowerDVD16Agent.exe, and PowerDVDMovie.exe.  It does sometimes leave the clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, or PowerDVD.exe processes still running, which I then manually have to end in Task Manager.  But this happens far less than how the previous version 14 would often leave these programs still running.  Most users will not notice or care about these leftover processes still lingering after the program is closed, but I frequently run CPU-intensive and memory-intensive programs, so I like to minimize the number of unnecessary processes.

As was also the case with PowerDVD Ultra 14, I have not noticed any strict licensing restrictions as I have been able to install PowerDVD 16 Ultra on multiple computers running Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, and 10.

If you are satisfied with the PowerDVD 15 Ultra that you previously installed, unless you can get a great upgrade price, the improvements in going from version 15 to 16 are far less than the improvements in going from version 14 to 15.

And if you are satisfied with using the free VLC media player, this PowerDVD 16 Ultra is quite expensive to get the extra features that you may not need or care about, and PowerDVD consumes a lot more memory than VLC. To me, one of the main convenience features of this PowerDVD version is the ability to directly play ISO images without the need of additional software to mount the ISO image.  But you can use the free version of Daemon Tools Lite to mount ISO images and play them with VLC too. On some slow computers, I have sometimes found VLC to stutter, lag, and drop frames during playback of some video content, whereas PowerDVD appears to utilize much better internal buffering to smooth out the playback and I rarely get dropped frames on PowerDVD.  But for unknown reasons, there are also various videos in MKV and AVI formats that play more smoothly on VLC than on PowerDVD. So for me at least, I like keeping both the latest VLC version 2.2.4 and this PowerDVD 16 Ultra on my Home Theater PC, because neither of these two media players can still play everything with equal smoothness.  But PowerDVD 16 Ultra now plays just about any kind of DVD and Blu-ray format that I throw at it.

So my 5-star rating is based on upgrading my previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra to this version 16.  If I was already using PowerDVD 15 Ultra, I would probably rate this 4 stars for upgrading from version 15 Ultra to 16 Ultra because this version 16 is not as much of an improvement from version 15.  But if you have version 14 or earlier, this version 16 is worth the upgrade.",0
"Turbotax basic allows the beginning user, or the person with uncomplicated taxes to file a quick and easy return.

"Visually, for folks who mainly use the Mac for entertainment, this is a minor upgrade--frankly not worth the bother. But for folks who use OSX for its power, speed and reliability this is a very significant step forward. Most importantly, perhaps, is spreading the workload among cores in multi-core hardware and rewriting old workhorses like Finder for 64-bit code (although it still looks much like the Finder of yore). Snopard, at last, is meeting the computing potential of current hardware, and seems CPU-ready for the oft-promised but slow-in-coming powerful software  that could take advantage of multicore hardware. For demanding users, this upgrade is well-placed and well-timed at an amazingly low price point.

Curiously, although BootCamp (for Windows cohabitation) has been upgraded as well - it mentions Vista compatibility - not a word on the forthcoming Windows-7 release - I'd wait till the dust settles on that issue with future updates. The upgrade went smooth as can be (except for a Canon printer needing new driver) and most applications like Apple iWork and the Adobe imaging line just kept on going; applications like Bento are explicitly Snopard-aware

A fabulous upgrade for serious Mac users, scientists, photographers and business people ... but a non-event for media-craving entertainment use.",0
"I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).",0

QNAP has one of the best reputations in the industry for quality and workmanship.  This has an extremely low power draw and I've acheived write speeds of 65 MB a second over gigabit ethernet which is far greater than USB 2.0 (roughly 25 MB a second).

I bought all enterprise drives for additional reliability (WD RE4) I'm currently upgrading to Hitachi Ultrastar 3 TB drives.  The new firmware (3.4) from QNAP provides support 3 TB drives.  So max would be 6 TB for Raid-1, 12 TB for (JBOD, RAID 0), and somewhere inbetween for Raid 5.

"I used Norton 360 for years and this is apparently the evolution of that software.  I now have it on all of my Windows computers and my Android cellphone.

I can't pay my bills easily without the password vault that keeps all of my passwords memorized and protected.  I have never found 1 password that makes all systems happy.  They have different requirements that some have to be 14 characters long but others are only 7, some need symbols, and others can't have symbols.  Its confusing but with this, I do just remember 1 password, the password for my vault.  If I actually need to see it I just log into my vault and then go to the details on that login.

I haven't ever had any problems with viruses in my life but I've run Norton most of my life so I don't think that's a coincidence.  I've gotten notification of things blocked or quarantined but never had any major problems so I trust Norton.

"Before working with Cyberlink PowerDirector I had not used any Cyberlink software beyond PowerDVD, an old version of which came with a computer I bought years ago. My first exposure to PowerDirector itself was version 10 and I was pleasantly surprised with the program. Version 11 makes some improvements over version 10. My review will focus mainly on version 11 independently.

Video editing and production software from most vendors works the same as music editing and production software packages. A timeline view allows the user to drag and drop content onto it and there is a plethora of special effects and transitions that can be applied to each element to make transitions easier and smoother. Users comfortable with the likes of Sony Acid or Cakewalk will feel right at home with this method of working.

PowerDirector provides a nice media manager that gives an excellent thumbnail view of all of the available content, and what comes with the package is a very good library of different types of content. The Media Room contains the actual media available immediately (though more can be imported without too much effort). The Effects Room contains a number of motion and blur effects that can be easily applied to visual elements on the timeline. The PiP (Picture in Picture) Room contains several animation elements, mostly drawing effects. The Particle Room contains a couple of motion-type effects that involve multiple embedded objects. The Title Room is for all things text and text effects. The Transition Room contains transition effects that apply to visual elements and made the change between two elements a lot smoother and/or more interesting. The Audio Mixing Room is a simple equalizer and sound balancer for audio elements. The Voice-Over Recording Room allows for direct recording into the production either through a microphone or from the sound card.

PowerDirector provides the ability to capture input from connected devices such as a webcam or a video recorder. The interface to these devices is very straightforward and simple - there's a record button that turns recording on and off, and there is the ability to change the location of captured content and resolution/bitrate settings.

PowerDirector is able to create media in a number of formats, both audio and video. Supported formats include AVI, MPEG-2, AVC, WMV, MPEG-4, MOV, and MKV files. I was unable to find MP3 file output which is a mild disappointment.

My son likes to make stop-motion videos with Legos, and for this task PowerDirector is well-suited. We have been able to import all of his photos at once (usually over 500 individual pictures) put them all on the timeline, change the display duration and create an initial cut at a video in less than 10 minutes. Cyberlink claims to have fast rendering speeds, and PowerDirector 11 seems to live up to those claims in our workings.

The Ultimate version differs from the Ultra (base) version in that it includes additional content packs and filters. These are nice-to-have additions but are certainly not required to be productive.

Comparing versions 10 and 11, while there is a speed difference and there is some minor tweaks in the interface to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing, I am not sure that there's a compelling reason to upgrade to version 11 if you already have version 10. The main considerations are the speed improvements and the content, and the content does not seem to have changed too much so it comes down to speed. If the optimizations that make version 11 faster than version 10 are crucial, then it's worth pondering the upgrade. Try the trial version first before committing to see if this is worthwhile.

I like PowerDirector. It's a powerful and easy-to-use video production application that does a nice job of allowing a user to assemble a video quickly. The interface is mostly intuitive and the inner workings are efficient. This is a good package at a very reasonable asking price.",0

"I never had a problem learning the english language or acquiring new vocabulary. Why then did I have a mental block learning a new language? Could it be the boring, repetition and grammer ? (yup!)

I am very pleased to report that I now can converse in elemantary German thanks to the Rosetta Stone learning system.  Imagine learning can be fun!

The total immersion approach teaches you a new language the same way you learned your first one through visual and contextural clues, repetition and a very cool speech analyzer that helps with pronunciation.  The Rosetta stone approach is the best thing next to a personal tutor since it is so comprehensive long time to download , probably because of server traffic.

I must admit, it took a while to build my confidence.  It has been a long time since the rigors of a college classroom.  At middle age, wasn't it supposed to be a bit harder for me to learn?  What I found, is that the mind is like any muscle.  With work, your can grow more nimble and strong.

The self pacing aspect of the program, makes it easier to remain positive and focused on progress and not worry about ""falling behind"".

I am really enjoying the challenge of learning a new language.  I look forward to adding other languages.

The software is of excellent quality. I find the photography outstanding and the voices attractive. It might sound silly to remark about this, but the user experience is intoxicatingly fun.

The big question, ""Is it worth it?""  For me, it is a definite ""Yes"". Although the software is a high price, it is by far the best ""learning experience"".  Since you want to learn a language, why not put the cost into perspective? If a cheaper product, turns you on, then go for it.  For me, the Rosetta stone experience makes me want to learn. That is worth the price of admission.",0

The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.",0

"This graphics suite consists primarily of CorelDRAW and Corel PhotoPoint.  There are a few additional programs, but they are more in the nature of utilities.  Both of the content creation programs are excellent.  They are top notch and the UI is intuitive and easy to use.  The massive, included guide is a great resource as well. There is a considerable overlap in the feature set of this product and Adobe's and for day to day use it should be a good replacement, especially when taking price into consideration.",0
"Every couple of years, I get on a kick to get into genealogy and research and document my heritage.  In some cases I am very fortunate, as some lines of my genealogy records so far go back almost 1,000 years.  In other cases because one side of my family recently emigrated (or more accurately, most are still in Iran), I have very little reliable information going back even 50 years.  So I can have both the puzzle and the satisfaction of a ton of information, and I need a lot of good research tools as well as a great way to organize my work.

I've used Ancestry.com before, without additional software, and the difference between the website and Family Tree Maker's GUI is substantial.  It's much faster and easier to work with this software.  I found the included documentation easy to use.  Importing pictures and documents was also easy, which was awesome as I have two very extensive word documents from two relatives that are now preserved for my family to enjoy.  I ran through a bit of the tutorial and found it well made, but the software was intuitive enough that I really didn't need it.  Exporting appears to be very straightforward as well.

For that matter, I put a lot of time into this software and have already exhausted my free month.  In that time I did not encounter any glitches.  Solid software.

Another point about Ancestry.com is that I don't really need a persistent subscription.  I'll get on this kick once in a while, usually just after the holidays, and then I'll go a year or more without having time for it.  This software gives me the best of both worlds as I retain my work and can even update my digital family tree, as well as share it with family when they visit, but I only have to pay for Ancestry.com on months where I'm going to be using it.  All my work is stored locally on my computer.

The different editions primarily pertain to the duration of the included membership.  I have the Essentials edition, which is the one I'd recommend as the best practical value, even though the Platinum costs less per month of Ancestry.com use.  And Ancetry.com is the real deal and will be of tremendous use to most people who are researching their family history.

The family tree viewing is dynamic and intelligently conveys relationship information in a variety of ways, especially for very detailed family trees in the Pedigree mode.  For me this had the effect of making it much more fun to include a lot more information and more relatives on my tree (and actually all of them).  The other effect is that people actually enjoy seeing my family tree, because it is actually easily presented on screen.

There's no better way to sum it up but to say this is a really good value for the money.",0

"This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon. This Gigabit switch (and it's larger ProSafe Plus kin) has port mirroring and other advanced functions for comprehensive service quality, diagnosing, and monitoring of network traffic on-the-cheap. It's impossible to find this stuff in the average, everyday un-managed switches at the lower end of the price pool where this one also swims.

To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0

"Right off, prepare to be irritated by the registration process for PagePlus: if you don't register the program by calling a *telephone number!!*, you will be pestered every time you start PagePlus. If you do register, be prepared to spend about 9 minutes speaking to customer service. This is rather incredible that in 2011 you still have to do this.

Apart from this rather annoying start, I have to say that PagePlus is a great piece of software. And complex. Luckily, the opening splash screen offers some help in the form of online video tutorials and also a 256-page User Guide. The quality of these guides are actually clear and pleasing to view, quite educational. The included Quick Start Guide gets you on your way if you're not a manuals reader like me. There is a LOT of very useful information here, if you have the time to go through them.

I was able to very quickly open one of numerous design templates and create a newsletter. The design templates come in a variety of colors and themes so for the newbie, it's incredibly useful--you can quickly create anything from calendars to scrapbooks, business cards, all sorts of fliers and posters.

The newsletter template I was using had two inserts for graphics which when clicked on opened an Import Picture window with a choice to either link or embed the picture. The process could not be easier! The layout is well-thought-out: to the right are the panes for choosing colors, lines, transparencies and schemes in addition to those for creating new pages, picking swatches (in RGB or CMYK format) and even a gallery from which you can choose cartoon icons/symbols and other graphics. The bottom bar holds a storage place for graphics and other media that may end up in your work.

The great thing is the end product which is available as an industry-standard PDF for publishing  or as a graphic. It is also possible to send the project file directly as an email attachment. In addition to all this, the features and tools available are staggering, from a ""LogoStudio"" for designing logos, to a built-in PhotoLab photo editor and even an Image Cutout Studio that enables the user to edit out or in backgrounds and other graphics. Truly outstanding.
I have to confess that I didn't think too highly of this product when I started because of the hassles I had with registration, but with each use, I see even more reason to like PagePlus. I am truly blown away by the feature-set available and all the tools available for creating the numerous types of publications you want.

"So far this matrix switch has been working great for us in a conference room environment.  Although we haven't really put this device through it's paces (testing video resolutions, noise levels, audio, etc.), this item has worked exactly how I had hoped right out of the box.

"Year after year, Norton provides very solid protection from online threats.  One feature that stands out is that is it very unintrusive:  You simply install it and pretty much forget it and let it work in the background.  This is very ideal to install for someone who isn't a computer expert, thus taking away most of the decision-making away from their fingertips.  It is barely a resource hog, although with the powerful machines these days, the days of anti-viruses slowing down your PCs are long over, unless you are still running an ancient system.

You no longer get a disc--You only get a code in the box!  Which makes sense because most of the time when you get a CD to install, chances are its already outdated and you have to install an update out of the gate.  This also keeps the environment cleaner.  Although why not just e-mail the code and not send me the box at this point?  You should also register this product on their website, just in case you need to re-install the CD, as the serial key is already stored there as well.  Power and simplicity--What else would you want from your Web security program?",0
"I've used various anti-virus/security software packages over the years (McAfee, Norton, etc).  There is no one software package that is going to catch everything but over the years I've gravitated toward Kaspersky products as doing the best overall job of catching as much as possible and not bogging down my computer.  Kaspersky Pure continues to work well for me in that regard.  I tend to be a cautious user so I don't pick up a whole of junk for Kaspersky to detect, but it has picked up things here and there.  I also run the free version of Malwarebytes software and to date it hasn't picked up anything additional beyond what KP already detected.  I also haven't had any software conflicts that sometimes arise between anti-virus software packages and the OS or other programs.  Pure does it's job and stays out of the way otherwise.  That's good enough for me.",0

"Norton Internet Security 2007 has to be one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.  It slowed my PC to an unacceptable level.  When I disabled some of its unnecessary functions, it continued to slow my PC and gave me the bonus of irritating & uneccesary notifications/ warnings.  I was a longtime, dedicated user of Norton, but that has changed.  Try something else and avoid reduction of speed, adding an addtional bar to screen your screen, additional clutter and other deficiencies. If Amazon had a rating for less than one star, I would have given one of those negative ratings.

Amazon should not sell an item with such poor quality. I have yet to see somebody say something good about it which would come close to justifying its negative characteristics. CAN SOMEBODY RECOMMEND AS BETTER ANTI-VIRUS?",1

I will admit that I do not go to a lot of websites where you might pick up something, I stay on well known sites that I am sure are clean, but I have strayed over accidentally to other sites and I have gotten attacked, but Norton has been able to stop the attack before it does any damage.",0

"TurboTax is easy to use and I trust it to remind me of things that would be easy to overlook. We've used TurboTax for more than 10 years. The user interface has improved over the years.

Two features I really appreciate are the ability to either walk through one step at a time, or to jump around easily if I want to. The other feature I like is the ability to switch between interview style to the ""forms"" mode where I can see the raw details shown in the government publication format.

I quit using a tax adviser years ago. One year I paid the tax preparer but I also used TurboTax in parallel. TurboTax returned almost $1,000 more than the tax adviser did. That was the last time I used the adviser.",0
"I was using Windows 98SE and overall was happy with it.  While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).  It seems like the Microsoft engineers really gave this a lot of thought and put it into action.",0
"I've used Cyberlink products for years - including the Powerdirector series.  The early series were prone to major errors on larger files.  Some of that may have had to do with operating on old obsolete systems with limited memory and slow hard drive speeds.  Fast forward to today where even the cheapest i3 system has more than enough power and RAM is cheap, plentiful, and you think nothing of it.  With that, the program seems to have had much of its bugs taken out.  Simply put:  It's now stable on large HD files.  The target audience here is the amateur to fledging entry level pro.  what separates Powerdirector from the more heavy weights is the ease of learning how to use it - it's simply easy to use with a low learning curve.",0

"This is my first time using AutoCAD and I found it very intuitive and easy to learn.  I have previously used other CAD packages like TurboCad Pro and Vectorworks.  The software works very well and so far I have not found any bugs in it.  It is not hard to see why AutoCAD is regarded as the industry standard.  As far as basic drawing tools are concerned AutoCAD works better than the competitors. The competing products sometimes have more ""advanced"" features but the basic drawing tools and mechanization are in my opinion inferior to the AutoCAD implementation and are just plain ""harder"" to draw with.  The only negatives I see are that a user manual was not provided even in PDF form, and the software uses the usual irritating product activation. I am not sure if Autodesk allows the software to be installed on an additional machine such as a laptop.

Overall this is an excellent product and highly recommended.",0
"I'm an illustrator and graphic designer, and I've been using CorelDraw Graphics Suite since... oh, gosh, probably version four. I don't know exactly, but I've been using it at least since the early nineties, so I've been using it almost from the start.

The school where I studied digital illustration, design and animation used mostly Adobe products on Macs. At the time, I'd take what I'd learned, go home, and then do the same thing with CorelDraw on my computer. I quickly discovered that there are two, maybe three, major differences between CorelDraw and those other programs.

1. CorelDraw Graphics Suite gives you several programs--like a vector-design program and a photo-manipulation program--in one and doesn't make you pay extra for filters and other features that should be included.

2. CorelDraw Graphics Suite is a lot cheaper than the full version of even one of those products. (Check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-CS6/dp/B007R0RKV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop CS6</a>&nbsp;to compare, and remember that Photoshop doesn't include a vector-design program.)

3. Most other illustrators and graphic designers still prefer Adobe products. I have no idea why, but they often look down on CorelDraw.

The fact is that there's nothing you can do with those other programs that you can't do with CorelDraw Graphic Suites. I once met a woman who ran a design studio, and she told me all the designers who worked under her used Adobe products--but she preferred to fix their work in CorelDraw. We both agreed it was the better program.

Why would you want to pay more to get less?

If you're an illustrator or artist looking for something that does a better job of imitating brushes and the like, I'd recommend a different Corel product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Painter-12/dp/B004YHXXKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Painter 12</a>. That, too, costs less than the Adobe equivalent and gives you more. It works best with a decent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-Tablet/dp/B001TUYU06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom Tablet</a>, or better yet, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-CINTIQ/dp/B008HB5K5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom CINTIQ</a>. Several of my friends who are illustrators or cartoonists consider the CINTIQ with Corel Painter to be essential, but the CINTIQ is very expensive. Still, if you're an illustrator or artist and you want the best of the best, that would be the way to go.

CorelDraw Graphics Suite just keeps getting better and better (although one thing long-time users know is that you only buy the even-numbered versions, because the odd-numbered ones tend to be buggy). X6 is the best version yet. I would recommend it to any designer.",0
"Vista is indeed a revolutionary OS. The user interface was a MAJOR improvement over XP. The Game Explorer is a very nice addition for gamers. And best of all, it doesn't crash! It's just stable.

I have used Vista Business since its release in January 2007 and it has been absolutely rock solid. It's fast (faster than XP even on systems with more than 4Gbs of RAM), much more secure than XP, compatible with older software, sexy Aero effects, and boasts loads of new features and improvements. And I already mentioned the much improved interface.

Yes, it does have a few bad things. UAC is one of them, but that can be easily turned off. Slow file transfer over the network was indeed a problem early on, but was fixed even before SP1 came out. And DRM is still just as bad as in XP.

Windows 7 is coming out in a few months, but it's not out now, so Vista still holds the crown as the best Windows version out there. Actually, Windows 7 is nothing but Vista SE with a new name. I ran the Windows 7 release candidate full time for a month, and realized that I had been running ""Windows 7"" since January 2007. Heh. I will still upgrade to Win7 though, if I find it for cheap (the current upgrade prices are NOT worth it if you already own Vista).

Overall, this OS has served me well over these past three years, and just felt compelled to write a positive review. Good job Microsoft! :)",0
"I've used this product in the past, so was a little familar with WillMaker Plus. It's pretty standard software. Load onto the computer and follow the steps to download it.

You can only use it for one person, so don't think about sharing it unless you want to purchase one that allows you to share with others.

As for this software... It even has a video to help you get started and to import contacts. Once you register, then you go right into the setting up your will.  In addition to a will, you get to create a durable power of attorney document, a health care directive and other documents that you may need. You can even create a final arrangements checklist for your survivors.

WillMaker also gives you other forms that are not really part of your will, but useful for folks. This includes such things as authorizations for minors, a housesitting agreement, request for a birth certificate. There is really a lot of forms that you may use in your lifetime, but probably several you never will. But WillMaker tries to cover all the bases.

It's convenient and easy to use if you're looking for a low cost alternative to hiring an attoreny.",0

"After installing this program (and activating it online) it adds a tab to the Office 2010 ribbon bar for PDF creation.  It couldn't be easier to create PDFs from Office documents.  While this one lacks the ability to batch convert, like PDF Converter does, it is easier to use generally.  After all, if you want to create PDFs, you are likely to be editing in Office when you need to create the PDF.

One caveat when running this program for the first time, however.  It will ask you if you want to make it your default PDF reader, DON'T!  It will come up with Vista Like security messages whenever you try to read PDFs with links in them.  Really a pain.  Stick to the free Adobe Reader as your PDF reading software.

Some people have complained about the DRM registration requirement, and while I agree with their points (this paranoid DRM scheme needs to end), I can't drop any stars as a result.  Maybe if I have to re-install some day and it won't let me, I'll come back here and knock off a couple of stars.",0
I've been using TurboTax for 20 or more years.  I like how it keeps track of my data and imports it into the new tax return.  It makes it quick and easy and less likely for user error.

"As a professional photographer and graphic artist I use several photo editing apps on a daily basis. I could offer no more important suggestion to anyone considering this app (or any other app) than, if you are serious about changing your snapshots into works of art, to own and use at least 2-3 different photo editing apps.

Where does this one fit in? Well, it's not PhotoShop which for most people is a good thing. PhotoShop can be daunting to learn and a challenge to use. Unfortunately at the other end of the scale are a lot of apps that are just as hard to use but can make a mess of your photos.

Personally, in addition to PhotoShop, for my professional and also for my own fun time I use Digital Image Pro, PhotoBrush, PhotoScape, Corel PaintShop and Painter and a few special effects apps, and now PhotoDirector.

What works for me may not be the same thing that works for you so I won't reiterate every individual spec of this app but will call out some of the more important things that can help you decide if you should purchase it:

1. It does a LOT for the price, so it almost becomes a no-brainer to pop $50 for such a powerful app.

2. It features non-destructive file saving ... a fancy way of saying it makes a copy of your original so you can play to your heart's content without messing up your original photo

3. The default presets are fantabulous. You can click through each of them until you find the one that suddenly makes your snapshot look like it was taken by Ansel Adams.

4. The tool to remove an element from a photo works better than the one I have used for years, and I use such a tool almost every day. No matter how well you plan a photo there is always something in the frame that distracts the eye, PhotoDirector makes it easy to remove it like it was never there.

5. The slideshow function is worth the price all by itself, easy to use and extremely professional.

What's not to like? I would have preferred that the top, bottom and side menus be a bit slimmer, they leave too small of an area for the actual photo you're working on if you're using a 22"", 23"" or 24"" monitor.

I have a bookshelf full of photo editing apps that I have evaluated and never used again. This one is a keeper and from a person who makes a living in photography I recommend it.",0
"Mac OS X has some satisfactory burning tools built into the operating system, so why spend $75 on Toast 7?  Well, Toast 7 does everything you wish your Mac could.

First, DVD burning.  Toast allows you to import all sorts of video files, and burn them onto a video DVD, for viewing in your set-top DVD player.  This is a great feature, if you have some Divx video files, on your hard drive.  Drag them into the video folder in toast, and burn a video DVD.

Furthermore, do you have some un-encrypted DVDs, perhaps ones made in your set-top DVD recorder with video camera footage of your family?  With toast, you can import titles from those unencrypted DVDs, and put them onto a DVD, with fun and easy to navigate menus.

New to Toast 7 is a great new feature that allows you to compress an unencrypted video DVD image into a size that will fit onto a single-layer disk.  This basically gives you the functionality of popcorn built right into Toast 7.

Data Backup - Toast works fantastic as a backup utility.  There is even an application included to schedule backups on a regular basis.  Toast 7 allows for disk-spanning backups, which allows you to backup many gigabytes of data over multiple DVDs or CDs.

Audio - Toast 7 will obviously allow you to burn music CDs, but you can also burn a DVD.  The DVD will load on a set-top DVD player, with menus, to select music, and a shuffle feature.  You can get gigabytes of music onto these disks, and then play them in your DVD player.

Pictures - Toast 7 includes an application called Motion Pictures HD, which allows the importing of photos to make great slideshows.  They can be in beautiful widescreen, or even high-definition, if you make a Divx DVD (note that Divx DVDs can only be played in special DVD players).

Import Analog Audio - CD Spin Doctor is included with Toast 7, so you can easily import analog audio via your computer's audio input.  You might input audio, from a VHS tape, cassette tape, or record.

Discus RE - Discus RE is a simple, but convenient way to create labels, for your DVDs.  It includes the templates, for dozens of the most popular DVD labels, so then all you have to do is design your label and print it.  Easy.

[...]

Overall, I have only had Toast 7, for a few days now.  However, it might be the most useful application I have ever purchased, for my Macintosh.  Toast 7 allows you to do just about anything you would want to do, when it comes to burning DVDs and CDs.  Furthermore, it is easy to use.  I was taking advantage of Toast 7's many features within just minutes of installing the software.  Give Toast 7 a try, for it will quickly become one of the most used applications on your Mac.",0

"I was forced to order Corel PaintShop Pro X4 when I reinstalled X2, and found out that Corel would not support it with necessary updates. A strike against Corel, as far as I am concerned.

I had a little difficulty with the new layout using tabs, but once I sorted through that and got used to it, I was able to do photo editing much as I had done on X2.

X4 does seem to load more quickly, but it sometimes freezes up on my HP 64 bit laptop running Windows 7 SP1, with 4 GB RAM and an Intel Core 2 Duo T6600 2.20 GHz. This is disappointing to me, as other programs run with no problem. I might add that X2 was also freezing up, and that was why that I had tried to reinstall it.

So far, I am satisfied with the overall performance of X4 for the things that I do. I have not tried any of the new features as of 02-22-2012.",0

"All three programs (Pages, Keynote and Numbers) have been improved (from iWork'08), but it is an unspectacular upgrade.
  *  Pages: introduced the outlining feature.
  *  Keynote: there were added new transitions and effects.
  *  Numbers:the biggest changes: about 90 (according Apple). - it is integrates with Pages for page merge

This is a great, easy to use product.",0
"This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon. This Gigabit switch (and it's larger ProSafe Plus kin) has port mirroring and other advanced functions for comprehensive service quality, diagnosing, and monitoring of network traffic on-the-cheap. It's impossible to find this stuff in the average, everyday un-managed switches at the lower end of the price pool where this one also swims.

To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0
"Loved this thing, i went thru so many external 56k modems on my laptop with dial-up internet kept pulling the wires out of it. This thing solved everything.

"I got a new home computer and was transferring files from my work laptop using my old 10T hub.  After over an hour, it was only one third of the way done. In frustration I bought this Asante switch.  Once I hooked up the Asante, the whole thing copied in 12 minutes!  At first I didn't believe it had actually copied everything.  But it was all there, just 25 times faster.  I should have got a faster switch years ago.",0
"Please be aware that the vast majority of the reviews for this product are false and probably written by employees of the competing product. Ok enough of that, lets get to this product.

We use this for our business and sofar have been very happy with this product. Sure there are some times the program offers services that are not included and probably should have been. It is very easy to use and a complete solution for our company. The other competing products are more aggressive with offering paid for addons. Sage 50 is more matter of fact when they offer them so its a bit more palatable. Our accountant loves this program because he uses it every day. I use it to check the reports he generates. We can import CSV files into the program fairly easily and this allows for faster integration of our data.

Pros:
+ Easy to use
+ Easy to install
+ Import data easily
+ Nice looking reports
+ Mostly complete

Cons:
- Payroll addon (come on shouldnt these be included???)
- Other addons that should also be included for the price.

Overall we will continue to use this software. The other alternative is just not worth the hassle and aggressive tactics.

Thanks for reading my review.",0
"I might be biased about this game because it was the first I ever played (and the first I ever finished -- since, when I started playing, I had all of the first five that I was flipping between, and six and seven came out very close on the heels of them, so I didn't actually finish any until a while after I'd received them).

However, biases aside, this game still holds as my all-time favorite. I will admit it isn't the best game in the series, but that's ok by me. It isn't extremely difficult, but it isn't overly easy. The characters are all interesting (and this game introduces my favorite ND character, Professor Hotchkiss). I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game. They hadn't yet refined things. However, in this game, every time you progress (almost) you get to unlock a new area in the game. There are so many places to go in this little castle, so many things to see.  This game gave me so much to imagine, so much to think on, and, now that I'm older, it gives me a ton of inspiration.

To anyone that hasn't played this game, I highly recommend it. If you've played other games but not this one, I'm completely shocked. You need to play this game NOW. And if you're looking for an introduction to the series, look no further. Treasure in a Royal Tower is a wonderful classic that I really hope will enthrall you as much as it has me these last ten years.",0

A good second fiddle for Microsoft Office.,0
"Sony usually has excellent software to bring to the table, and they're keeping that trend going with the Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite. Installed on a Microsoft Windows 8 Professional machine with an Intel Core i7 processor, this editing suite is super stable and leverages the multi-core and hyper-threading features very well making this suite very efficient and fast.

The various editing tasks are assigned to their own editing programs within the suite, making each editing task such as audio, video, and so-forth more focused with better working features that aren't just all clumped together and inefficient. Sony allows you to focus on the specific task at hand without distractions, and the navigation through the various settings and tools is very intuitive and easy.

If you do a lot of video editing, this suite will end up saving you a lot of time in the long run because of it's efficient and well laid out design that lends itself to a smoother workflow. Bear in mind, however that is a more simplified, consumer oriented suite that is meant to provide with both the basics and quite a few extras, without over-encumbering the suite with a lot of professional level features that most people wouldn't be able to take advantage of, but also without stripping out too many of the features, making this a very well balanced editing suite perfect for the beginner and advanced hobbyist alike.",0
works as expected,0
"The Corel Suite X4 Installed on my Windows XP Pro system with Service Pack 2 without any problems.  Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.

The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.",0
"This is a fantastic product! I put off using it for a while after it came. It's kind of a grim thing to think about, but we are all mortal, and it's very important to make sure this kind of business is taken care of. I thought it would be complicated and that I would need a lot of information to get started. Not so!
When I opened the box, I found not only the CD with the software (Windows XP/Vista/7/8,), but also the handy, easy-to-understand handbook from NoLo, The Legal Answer Book for Families with basic advice from lawyers relating to marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, adoption, children, and elder care.
This information will be very useful for people with large families and complex issues related to their estates. Our current situation is very simple, so I did not need it to set up a will, but I am glad to have it as a reference.
NoLo's self-help legal guides have worked for my husband and me before. We handled his mother's estate, which turned out to be more complex than we had expected, using one of their books, and everything went well.
To use the software, simply load it into your computer, register it, and then answer some very simple interview questions. Then, hit print, and all the documents you need for your state and county will print out, ready to be witnessed and signed. That's it. You can also print out record pages to collect and keep track of your assets. We are going to do that when we prepare our taxes in January.
As a bonus, you get a free one year subscription to NoLo's Living Trust service online.
We have been worried about this particular task for a long time. It seemed so complicated. It was a relief to see how easy it was. A little time now (a few minutes) can save many people a lot of money and grief later. I recommend it!",0
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.

Also, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",0

I was moving from a Dell laptop with Windows XP installed to an Acer Aspire, with Windows XP and some other software already installed.  I was worried about duplications, so I deleted some software from the Acer before starting.  There's a long list of instructions to follow and the sequence is important.  They are presented twice: in the manual, and again on the screen as ysou go through the process.  It takes a while ( five hours), but in the end all software and files were transferred, even Quicken and Eudora (which I use a lot.)  Well worth the money!",0

"Need to network computers on different floors?  This product can be used as a bridge or as an interface for an individual machine.  All I had to do was take the units out of the box, plug them in to the power line and the Ethernet switch (using the supplied patch cable), and it all worked right away.  Just a word of warning, though;  you can't plug these into a surge protector (including any surge protector inside a power strip.)",0
"I'm a Photoshop professional- I use Photoshop daily and have for many years. Most of what you can do here you can do in Photoshop, of course, but it's a lot harder to learn and the cost difference is phenomenal-- $40 vs $6-700! So my review will have some bias. That said, CPSPX4U is a delight. I won't run down the individual features as many others have done a great job describing them.

I can imagine a bit of a learning curve for someone who hasn't used any image editing software, but it's worth taking the time to learn. My advice to beginners is to explore. Open a copy of whichever photo you want to manipulate (ALWAYS work on copies- whichever program you're using!) and start trying each section. Within a section, explore the tools and within each tool, explore the variations you can use.

For the intermediate user, someone who has used other photo-editing software, I think you'll enjoy the different approaches you'll find in this application. Let yourself go wild and play. Work using a succession of copies, then toss the ones that don't work out and save the good variations.

For professionals who create digital art - I find using another program - even if you work primarily in Photoshop or Illustrator, is particularly helpful from a creative perspective. Sure, you can pretty much do everything in your main app, but I'm willing to bet you didn't think of many of these ideas- so having them in front of you is wonderful. We ALL get set in our ways -- working in a different application forces us to create with a different tool - and I believe you can't have enough tools at your disposal. I don't use secondary apps for the primary things I do in Photoshop as much as for the filters, layer effects, etc, available in another app. PaintshopProX4 Ultimate has a delightful range of filters and plugins. I find switching between Photoshop and Paintshop Pro (or Corel Paint) offers me the widest range of inspiration within my work. I recommend this app for all levels of users- you simply can't go wrong for the price.",0

Even with all the info, I don't think I would close on a property purchase without an agent and lawyer. But I feel like there's enough documentation in this software that I could do my homework and educate myself before intelligently speaking to an agent. I probably won't use 75% of the information here, but it's very nice to know that information is available and reliable.",0

"I prefer Trend Micro to MacAfee, Norton and other protection software. After years of fighting with protection software, it was a pleasure to use Trend Micro, which provides me the security I need without the compatibility headaches so common with this type of software.

Trend Micro AntiVirus + AntiSpyware allows you to send and receive email and share files with protection from malicious viruses, Trojan horse programs, and spyware. This product does not provide Internet security. For full protection, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trend-Micro-Internet-Security-Pro-3-0/dp/B002EAYJEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trend Micro Internet Security Pro 3.0</a>.

For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I look for three things:

1. Easy to install and easy to use
2. Operates without slowing down my laptop
3. The software works; viruses and spyware are stopped before they cause trouble.

Trend Micro meets all of those expectations. I wrote a five-star review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trend-Micro-Antivirus-Antispyware-2009/dp/B001CPJHGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware 2009</a>, but noted that this is a basic level of security. Too often, consumers confuse the basic protection packages with the ""Pro"" versions.

"Installed perfectly on Windows XP. Imported last years tax data perfectly.

Manually downloaded information from all my financial institutions, using the correct import file that the firms make available for manual import. (Not the import button in Turbo Tax)

IMPORTANT!  Remember to get the correct file from your broker since the import function button in Turbo Tax does not import your cost basis for stock or options. Unless you do, you will have to fill this out yourself.  Talk about time, and time is money..Get the right file!

I find that there really is no need to buy the more expensive version, this product does schedule C for my business and home office. I used the Home and Business last year and quite frankly found very little difference in the product. Annoyingly, Turbo Tax kept asking me to upgrade.

This year I knew that e-filing would cost and I gladly paid for it since I was afraid of the IRS's human/scan error in transcribing and I only paid $29 for Turbo Tax with State this year from Amazon.

Received my State Refund in a week, and I my Federal Refund in 2 weeks. No extra costs, deposited right into my bank account.

I still use the forms function to fill in most information, since that is quickest.

ItsDeductable software is useless, time consuming and I question the high amounts it gives to used, very good condition clothing. For my purposes, I claim 10% of the new purchase price for a deduction. If a suit cost $125, the donation is $12.50. Come on guys, I've worn the suit--How can it be worth $65? Maybe this is why Turbo Tax sells extra audit protection?  Since I did not pay for ITsDeductable, I still give Turbo Tax Five Stars this year.

"I have to admit that I've bad-mouthed Corel more than once in my life, especially back before my employer saw the light and dumped WordPerfect Suite for Microsoft Office, but I have nothing but praise for CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4.

If you're like me and don't have a single artistic bone in your body (I can't draw a straight line with a ruler), you would expect a fancy-pants software package like this to leave you dumbfounded from the start, with no clue on how to get started.  Much to their credit, Corel throws you lifelines as soon as you jump in the pool and makes a diverse set of rescue resources near at hand for you at all times.  I'm not saying you'll be a graphics design guru after a couple of hours - this is a really advanced,  powerful set of programs here - but you would have a hard time finding a piece of software with more impressive built-in support.  The first of several excellent video tutorials is available on the Welcome screen, and you can choose to have a built-in docket of usage tips available for every function you choose.  Users of previous versions of the software will have no problem recognizing the changes this upgrade brings with it, as you can choose to have every single change and addition from your previous version highlighted on the screen.  That doesn't sound like much, but it is a big help.  You also have What's New and Learning Tools readily available to you from the Welcome screen as well as from inside each of the featured programs.  Of course, you also have a complete help file available but you won't need to resort to using that very often.

As I'm sure you can tell by the price, you don't buy this program if you just want to take the redeye out of your vacation photos or create a cute little Christmas card to send to friends.  You can certainly do those things with this, but Corel Photo-Paint X4, impressive as it is, is overshadowed by the primary CorelDRAW application.  (If all you want is a powerful photo editor, I would still recommend Fireworks - my favorite - or Photoshop.)  I would like to have seen a few more built-in templates included, but CorelDRAW actually succeeds in making graphics design possible for even artistically inept folks like me.  This is one powerful program which actual graphics professionals should take to like fish to water.  Professionals may be the primary target audience for this software package, but Corel does a great job of making these powerful tools available and actually useable by anyone.

I also have to mention several additional software applications and features included in this suite deal.  Corel PowerTRACE X4 is of enormous help in turning traced bitmaps into images you can convert into editable vector images.  Corel CAPTURE X4, as you might guess, is a powerful screen capture utility.  The Bitstream Font Navigator is a comprehensive font manager that even helps you identity scanned fonts from an outside source.  You even get a Duplexing Wizard to aid you in optimizing the appearance of your document when printing two-sided copies.  Vista users will also welcome the integration of this software package with the Vista operating system, as the search and preview options by themselves should be of great convenience to them.

What about file formats and the age-old question of compatibility?  After all, the odds are that some if not many of your associates are working with different file formats in non-Corel software.  Well, Corel has worked to make CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 software as compatible as possible with other users and systems.  In this release, the list of additional new formats includes Word and Publisher 2007, AutoCAD DXF and AutoCAD DWG, and Adobe CS3.

I could go on writing paragraph after paragraph about this product, but I could never begin to describe all of its many impressive features.  Is it the best graphics design software on the market?  I don't know, as I have no experience using any comparable graphics design programs.  Even if I had, I don't think anyone short of a professional graphics designer would be able to judge the comparative pros and cons.  What I do know is that anyone who is serious about graphics design in any of its various facets would do well to give CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 a long and serious look.",0
Good product.  Wish I could get another copy.,0

"Update 9/07- I would now have to downgrade NSW (ALL year versions!), to a ""1""!-
At the time Norton was good, other than slow loading, and a RESOURCE HOG (expert tests show uses system resources of 1308%!)!
I now use #1 rated (7 years) NOD32 anti-virus (only slows system 4%!)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOD32-Antivirus-System/dp/B000RKY4ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOD32 Antivirus System</a>
It's a fairly complex /difficult to setup (see ""Blackspears NOD32 setup""- Google it), but worth it! For more startling stats see the NOD32 Anti-Virus comparative (their web site)...

You MUST first COMPLETELY uninstall NSW, before installing NOD32...!-
Norton now provides you with an easy ""ALL products"" uninstall tool called ""symnrt"" (search their web site!)(Don't Add/Remove anything, but the leftover pgms)(After a restart!))).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Old review-
I am a home software tech (28 years).
I can see why SO MANY reviewers had so many NSW problems...!- NSW is tricky..., and difficult to install PROPERLY, especially if you had old Norton..., or ANY other anti-virus (see ""Fix-It Utility 6..."", below)!! NEVER run two ""active"" anti-virus, or anti-spyware!
My install procedures... (below) can be adapted for ALL Norton antivirus..., or any others (corrupted system too...!)!

Features+!-
1. NSW 2006 automatically updates NEW virus definitions DAILY (0-25). ALL older versions only update ""once a week (no matter how often you run Live Update!)""!
When NSW daily updates definitions, it automatically does a ""Quick Virus Scan""!

2. My email... scanning is MUCH faster, than with old Norton!
a. My Symantec total System Performance Test went UP from 295 to 1350 (DELL XPS400, 3.2ghz Pentium D cpu, Raptor 10,000rpm single sata hard drive (WOW!), 2000mb memory)!
b. System antivirus scan is a little slower, but more thorough (found 2 viruses my old Norton missed!)! Protection center takes a minute on startup to scan for security problems- GOOD!).
You should also consider GOOD ""full time"" spyware protection!-
#1 Spyware Doctor (84%, latest independent test...), or
#2 SpySweeper (66%). The rest are abysmal!

~~~
1. The biggest reason that sooo many people have dificulties..., is that they don't ""COMPLETELY"" get rid of their old antivirus/""LiveUpdate..."" first!!!
A simple add/remove... uninstall, won't do it!- Browse the Symantec support..., for uninstall instructions on your ""EXACT"", product BEFORE you attempt an uninstall (see SymNRT...)!
I found Symantec free email tech support to be fast (48 hrs max) and EXCELLENT!

Note A- Procedure (takes 1 hours+, to do it right!)! Print procedure out, before trying (VERY detailed/complex!)!

Note B- You may think this long procedure is a hassle..., but much better than a full system reinstall! It's FUN when things... go right, and an ""advanced"" learning experience!!!

 IMPORTANT NOTE C!- ALWAYS wait for your HD (Hard Drive) light to stop blinking (for 15 seconds)!- Just because ANY application... says Finished/Restart Now..., it hasn't removed/written/finished ALL the registry/files... yet! SLOW DOWN, & you'll see HD blinking!

Backup your ""critical..."" files (Favorites, cookies, email address book..., email ( I recommend ABC Outlook Express!- saves all & trees too!)  to an ""external"" source.

I  then use Acronis 9 (same as Ghost, but dependable!) for a ""Full Image Backup"", to a Western Digital external HD, and really like it (see my amazon.com Acronis 9 review...)! Easily restore your WHOLE system. Acronis is not compatible with Ghost or GoBack (NSW... also recommends NOT installing GoBack!)!

1. Disconnect from internet & restart.

2. COMPLETELTY uninstall/remove ALL previous Norton/Symantec... pgms &  tracks...!-
 a. Uninstall ALL old Norton... pgms- Norton..., GoBack, Ghost, Live Update, WMI, Live Reg... Restart after each! SLOW DOWN!
 b. Symantec uninstall NSW advisory, tells you how to FIRST disable ALL NSW services (VERY complex!), as XP uninstall will not ""completely"" remove old NSW files/registry... in use (many processes are hidden...!)!
You should not have to do this IF you ""lastly"" run #1 Fix-It Utilities 6 (see my Amazon.com review!). I disabled services... & Fix-It still found/deleted over 250 invalid registry/files (Cleanup, Fix Registry... Green only!). My ONLY ""safe"" registry/file cleaner that found/deleted ALL...!
Restart.

3.  Run chkdsk... (to repair ANY System/file errors...!)-
My Computer, RIGHT click on C drive, Properties, Tools, Error Checking, check Auto
Fix... (ALWAYS check!- System errors too!).
Restart, ""TWICE!"" & SLOW DOWN (all changes don't take effect, until HD light stops blinking!)!
  a. Defragment your HD ( I recommend Diskeeper 10 Professional Premier!- REALLY speeds up your computer (40%+ WOW!)!!!- see my amazon.com review)).
  1. WAIT 1 minute (Registry changes, after ANY defrag is slow!)! Restart!  You can also defrag from C Tools (as in error chkdsk... procedure above, but- Defragment Now instead of Error Check...)...

4. Now you are ALMOST ready to install NSW- On to ""Clean Install Mode""!-
ALL services & programs MUST be stopped (especially anti-spyware! See my amazon.com review on SpySweeper!).
This is how to safely/easily do a ""safe/clean install"" (for that matter- ALL pgm installs!), in disabled... mode.
 a. Start, Run, put "" msconfig "" (sans quotes) in box. OK
  1. Put a dot in Selective Startup. Remove check from Load Startup Items. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  2. OK, Cancel (gray boxes. Wait for hour glass & HD lights!)
  3. wait 1 minute & Defrag again (slow down! This makes NSW files contiguous/performance!) & restart TWICE...!

4. Now to install NSW (no internet, firewalls, no nothing!)-
 a. Dot in Custom Install!
  1. Uncheck- !GOBack! (Per NSW- plays havoc..., even if you don't have Acronis!). Utilities box, uncheck- System Doctor, Speed Disk, and any others...,  you don't use...
  2 . Good ones!- WinDoctor, DiskDoctor, Explorer Extension... (if you don't know..., leave them)...

b. IMPORTANT NOTE!- During the install it check/asks you if you want ""Worm Protection"". This is REALLY a sorta firewall, in disguise (I had to start over here... DRAT!, as it conflicted with my Sygate 5.5 firewall! DRAT)!
Luckily I had an Acronis system restore backup! (XP restore is flaky... & doesn't do it ALL!)!
  1. ONLY If you don't already have a 3d party firewall ( I really like Sygate ""5.5!, only!""!), REMOVE the check.
  a. If you only have the standard XP firewall, leave it in!
  3. Install NSW be VERY patient & SLOW DOWN (always!)!

c. Remove CD, Restart . SLOW DOWN!
  1. Manually start your 3d party firewall (if you have one), & log onto internet (hope you have high-speed!).  You may have to do this around... the NSW messages...
  2. Wait awhile, & Norton Protection Center will keep coming  up with ""do now..."" alerts!
  a. Whatever you do, ""always"" exit this now...!
  b. Whatever you do DON'T run ""One Button Checkup...""!
  3. Actvate NSW... (I didn't register?)
  4. If Live Update doesn't come up automatically (slow)-
Open NSW... & do a ""Live Update (biggy!). Be VERY patient (seems like not-responding, but is really working...). Restart when asked. SLOW DOWN!
  5. Enable 3d party firewall, and Live Update again. Keep doing this until no more updates.
Restart.

5. Disconnect from internet & go back to Run/msconfig..., and remove the gray check from Load Startup Items, again. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  a. Defrag again (packs NSW files, for performance).
  1 minute, & Restart.
b. Now go back to Run/msconfig... & put dot in ""Normal Startup"". Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  1. Log onto internet. Restart.
  C. This is a GOOD time to do another Acronis backup!

6. DANGER!- All NSW Cleanups... will delete your IE favorites & cookies! To save them...-
  a. Open NSW, Options, Norton Cleanup, Internet Clutter & remove check from cookies..., ""Saved Web Sites"" folder & ""Import Favorites"", Apply, OK.
Restart (ANY changes... don't take full effect, until AFTER a restart!).

7. Now schedule a weekly system scan- Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Scheduled Tasks, RIGHT click on Norton Scan..., Properties, Schedule (set time...), Apply, OK. Close out... & Restart.
Do an Acronis back up...!

DONE!

"I've been a TurboTax user since 1998. Of all the things a PC brings to a household, one thing I appreciate most is the taming of the onerous chore of tax preparation into something much simpler. Tax time for me used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations and HOPING I had all the correct forms. TurboTax has turned three days of extended misery into a couple hours of compressed misery. Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Happily, those days are far in the past.

This version allows you to prepare up to five federal returns. Installation and updating were painless on a Windows 7 machine. Because I had data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and it smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year. It also handled a major change in our filing status.

With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Sweet. Error checking and efiling was painless, and I am now eagerly awaiting a modest federal refund while procrastinating re-investing that into the userious coffers of my home state:-)

Awesome. A money and time saver.,0
"As a long time Quicken user, as well as a Beta tester, this is by far the best release in recent history.  The new features that allow monitoring of your credit score is a very nice feature but the X-Ray feature allows you to understand your investments to ensure that you are not under or over allocated in a particular sector.  I have been doing this manually but it is now a breeze with Quicken Premier 2015.

Also, if you haven't previously used the Quicken mobile app for tracking your spending with your mobile device, you will quickly learn to love this feature with the improvements in 2015.

This is by far the most stable Quicken I have tested and used and the improved interface makes it even easier to use.",0
"NAV 2009 is so much faster than previous versions. I can browse and shop online knowing my laptop is protected. I recommend this product to everyone. I use it on my game computer and it run smoth. I'll recomend this solution for everone, there is no better solution out there in the shop's.",0

"If you include the beta version, I will have used Windows 7 since May. I have had the official version for over a month now (Received an early copy) I must admit the upgrade experience is a hassle but once you install Windows 7 you will be pleasantly surprised. I recommend a clean install for all users. Windows 7 has a noticeably snappier boot time than Windows Vista. What users will notice most are the changes to the interface. It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions. Windows 7 also includes a comprehensive device drivers, I have only had an issue with an old printer where Windows 7 could not find the drivers. I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used.

Improvements/Pros/New Features
-New Taskbar interface, each program is represented by an icon for a clutter free taskbar
-Quicker boot times
-Comprehensive driver library
-Supports many devices out of the box
-Less annoying
-Networking

Recommendations
-Microsoft Security Essentials: A free antivirus program provided by Microsoft that fights viruses, spyware, rootkits, and Trojans. This program is a separate installation, and is also compatible with XP, Vista, and 7.

-Ninite: Free program that provides easy PC Setup, and helps to install Multiple Applications at once. Is a lifesaver for Windows 7 upgrades. Caveat, limited to popular programs such as pidgin, flash, firefox, skype, itunes

-FYI, if you are a student with a .edu email address, you can get a limited time offer for Windows 7 Premium Upgrade from Microsoft for $60. Just google ""741""",0
"It has been said that the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is caused from a perceived disconnection from the Divine--either within oneself or in the universe at large.

We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.

Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.

In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.

Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:

*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video

*More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""

*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh

*Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors

*""Light Stone"" energy translator

*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences

*Original Soul Flight music CD

*Companion Guide and User's Manual

The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.

The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

"I love it when a game is able to truly surprise me. I was a bit skeptical of all the high praise leveled at WORLD OF GOO, and was ready to be underwhelmed by it, but decided to give it a Goo. I'm glad I did! This is a really entertaining logic game with interesting visuals, unique gameplay, and an overall aesthetic that elevates the game above the sum of its parts.

The objective is to navigate balls of goo from one location to another, defying gravity and other laws of physics in the process. By building structures, moving blobs of go to strategic locations, using special tools, and essentially figuring out ways to use what you have to accomplish the objective. All of this is done with the mouse, meaning gameplay is both simple and complex at the same time. Simple to make things happen, but complex to solve the increasing difficulty of the levels.

This is also a wonderful game to teach kids how to think and problem solve without them knowing it! This will build critical thinking skills, and is a lot more fun than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/something-like-this/dp/0894558951/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">something like this</a>!

Overall I was really impressed with this relatively inexpensive game. Another thing worth mentioning is that WORLD OF GOO is totally free of invasive DRM. Worth buying for its own merits, it is doubly so because its makers have decided to treat their customers with respect.",0
"I have used several different computer security products, and I found this one very easy to install, and minimally invasive.  I would highly recommend it.",0
"I wish I were more artistic and had more patience for tedious work. However, I still enjoy trying to create interesting artwork. The mirror function helps even the non-artist to appear to have some natural skills. To me, this is the best feature I've ever seen included in professional art creating software. I like using the layering technique a lot, too. You do need a tablet to draw.  A mouse just doesn't work for me. It is just too difficult to maneuver.

The installation went very smoothly with my 64-bit Windows OS. I have yet to see any instability or crashes. The response time is excellent. I admit that I am using an Intel i7 based desktop computer with 12 GBytes of RAM and two solid state disks. So I would definitely expect it to perform well.

It comes with an excellent hard cover book with many full color pages showing the capability of this software. I think most of the beautiful artwork shown is far beyond my ability as an artist. You still need some artistic skill to master this program and receive its full benefit. So if you are in that gifted category, I believe this product is meant for you.",0
Turbo Tax is easy to use and asks questions to cover all topics. It explains all sections in great detail.,0
"I have had Webroot for the last several years. It works well and the price is quite good compared to others that are similar. Viruses are lurking in the most innocent looking places, unfortunately.  One simply cannot be without an Internet Security program, and I use the Internet for work as well .At this price, peace of mind is very affordable. I wish the installation process were a little simpler, but then again, I am not tech minded. I have tried other programs and this one is the best for the money.",0
"I've been using Norton anti-virus and backup products for years.  While they had their installation and usage problems early on, they have gotten better year by year.  This year's edition installs flawlessly on Vista, Win7 and Win8 computers.  While Norton occasionally informs us that it has blocked an intrusion, we have never had any spyware, malware or virus problems while using this product.
Not only that, but Amazon's download prices are the best, far cheaper than purchasing the product directly from Symantec.",0
"The thing I like the most about the AVG Anti-Virus and Spyware software is that it runs in the background without bothering me and most of the time I don't even know it's there.  I've used an earlier version of this software for just over a year, so when I saw this package being offered I ordered it for my husband's new PC which is running Windows 7.  I like not having all the advertising pop-ups that I've had to deal with on other anti-virus programs and I also like that it doesn't seem to affect the speed of my computer when booting like some other titles have done in the past.  I also like the fact that it installs very easily, just a few clicks of the mouse and you're on your way.  What is under the hood may be complex, but from where I sit it's very easy to use and I've never had any problems with a virus.

This product comes with technical support although I've never had any reason to use it.  It's pretty simple and straightforward.  Another thing I like is it scans your downloads of music, files, and applications and does it in the background without slowing you down and it's behind the scenes where you don't even realize it's happening.  You also get free upgrades automatically and scans automatically on a schedule that you can decide.  You can also do a scan whenever you want by simply opening the AVG control center.  There's a thing called LinkScanner SurfShield which ensures every website you visit is safe and you get a message if there's a question so you can avoid the site or override the software and take your chances.

All in all, it's a great security program.  Fast, easy to use, doesn't bother you with a bunch of ads for add-on products and you are hardly aware that it's there working for you.  Best of all, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",0
"Kaspersky Lab is a Russian computer security company and ranks fourth in the market share for antivirus software. This software includes Safe Money.  That's an interesting program that allows the user to visit a site whose security credentials aren't yet established while at the same time allowing for a ""sandboxed"" transaction. It slows down my Windows 7 environment but that's the cost of running the two.",0
"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product.",0

"Over the past two weeks, I have been testing the VMware Fusion 2 product.  Wow, I have to admit that I am seriously impressed with this software package.  It truly makes using Windows a seamless experience that is truly enjoyable!  Here is what's so great about Fusion 2:

1) It makes installing Windows a fun and ""fearless"" experience.

In the past, I have always used Apple's Bootcamp (a competing product) to run Windows on my Macbook Pro (2.4 GHz with 4 GB of RAM).  Only problem is that Apple's Bootcamp program can be a ""little confusing"" to use -- and when I first went to install Windows on my new Mac, I apparently didn't read the technical installation manually as carefully as I should of, and accidentally wound up wiping out my machine to the point that it wouldn't start.  Oh oh...  Not good!  ;-)  I eventually got it back up and running, with Windows installed on it, but it really wasn't the most user-friendly way of installing Windows on my Mac!

However, with the introduction of VMware's Fusion 2, the process of installing Windows just became a real snap!  When I first started the program, it asked me if I would like to install Windows on my computer.  I said yes and it prompted me to insert my Windows installation disc into the drive.  The moment that I did this, it took control over the installation and after a bit, I have Windows freshly installed on my computer!  (Also, for those of you who want to use your Bootcamp partition, they give you the option of simply using it, or even migrating it directly to your Mac, as a virtual drive -- which helps to free up tons of space on your drive!)  It works seamlessly...

2) Run both Windows and Mac applications together at once!

This is one seriously cool feature of VMware Fusion 2.  Since Windows is running virtually on your machine, it means that you can unify both your Microsoft Office applications and your Mac programs together as one powerful software suite.  Fusion 2 comes with a feature called ""Unify"" that allows me to start up my Mac contacts and Microsoft Excel at the same time.  I can exchange information between these programs simply by using ""copy and paste""!  Also, unlike Apple's Bootcamp software, I don't have to reboot my system every time that I want to use a program from the other OS.  This makes both me and my Mac more productive!

3) Run your favorite PC games on the Mac!

If you're like me, you probably enjoy a little break here and then -- and that means playing a computer game, once in a while.  ;-)  Best of all, with Fusion 2, you can enjoy a wide selection of PC games on your Mac, as if they were designed for it.

4) Excellent Hardware Support

Out of all of the virtualization that I have played with over the years, Fusion 2 (by far) is years ahead of the competition.  They have written plug-ins for your operating systems that enable full hardware support, such as iSight cameras, USB drives and the ability to print over the network.  These are very welcomed features in my mind that place this software package above the competition.  This helps to make running Windows (and Linux) a vastly superior option.

THE DISADVANTAGES:
Honestly, it's kind of hard to find very many with this program, as it seems that the developers took the time needed to develop a well-tested application.  However, I did find a few, minor issues that you will want to be aware of:

- Product Deactivation for Bootcamp users

If you already have Windows installed and running on your computer, Fusion 2 gives you the ability to run it virtually.  When I ran Windows XP virtually for the first time, Windows immediately deactivated both the operating system and my copy of Microsoft Office.  Also, Adobe Creative Suite CS2 immediately deactivated too, which was not good.  To fix this, I had to reactivate my products, which means that you may have to spend some time on the phone waiting for customer service to give you permission to re-use your software again.

- There seems to be an issue with Time Machine.  I have a USB hard drive connected to my Macbook Pro and while it's connected, it actually prevents Windows XP from being able to successfully boot.  To fix this problem, simply disconnect the drive (during the booting process) and everything will work fine!

- Out of two weeks of heavy usage, I experienced only one minor crash.  VMware Fusion 2 handled it beautifully and no data was lost.

IN SUMMARY:
This is one AWESOME product that I highly recommend.  Don't waste your time with Apple's Bootcamp -- make the switch of being able to truly enjoy your mac the way you want.  Yes, nowadays, who says you can't have it all...  ;-)",0

"GLO Premium is a fantastic piece of software for everyone from the casual bible studyist to dedicated students, and can also be a valuable resource for teachers and preachers. The program is stable, well thought out, easy to navigate and is packed full of features, making it an incredible value. GLO Premium installed quickly and easily on my homebrew Vista x64 Intel Core i7 system, full install taking less than 15 minutes from start to finish, using all 3 discs provided. GLO has proven to provide a new way to study the bible in the digital age, giving a streamlined and efficient approach to learning and exploring the bible that would take hours longer manually cross-referencing multiple material via reference books. Highly recommended!",0
"It works simply, effectively in the background.  I don't have any of the annoying problems that I have had with Norton and McAfee.  Since I have not had any viruses or other attacks, I can only assume that it is doing its job well.

"Ideally, I would write a review for an anti-virus program after running rigorous tests to subject it to various malware to see how much it detects.  Perhaps you'll understand when I confess that I haven't done anything of the sort.  What I have done is use Kaspersky Anti-Virus for the past few years and have had no issues with viruses.  How much of that is due to the software and how much to my generally being careful about what I download, and from whom?  That's difficult to say, but I'll lay out what little I can actively see about the program.

As far as keeping me safe, Kaspersky does issue warnings to me if I start to go to a website that they have reason to believe is problematic.  I generally take the advice and steer clear of them and haven't had any regrets on that score.  The other major selling point is kind of the opposite side of that coin, namely Kaspersky doesn't pop up all the time with annoying messages that either ask me to do things or tell me that it's done something.  It simply loads in the background whenever I boot the system and quietly does its job.  I've had anti-virus software in the past that was a lot more intrusive so this has been a major plus.

In summary, I don't pretend to be an expert on determining which anti-virus software is the best.  But I use my PC for hours every day and have had zero problems since I started using Kaspersky.  The program is also very well behaved and neither tortures me with popups nor does it interfere with games or other programs as some security packages do.  To the extent I'm able to judge it, there is literally nothing I know of that I wish were different.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good no-hassle anti-virus program.",0
"I have used H&R Block (or Tax Cut) for over 10 years.  I got the disk this time and it has installed and updated with no issues.  I am using a Win 7 machine.

The only caveat is you must have the right hardware before you upgrade.  According to PC World 90% of upgrade troubles occur because people don't heed the system requirements.
Once you upgrade, you won't regret it.  Windows is getting better and better!",0

"There are SO many things you can do with this software. I have an online hunting and camping store and this is great to help create flyers... they look SO professional! And it's easy to use. I used the Microsoft ""test drive"" to see how this software works and it's a good thing to do. I don't recommend the 60 day free trial ( I lost all my old Outlook emails when it expired .. if you know how to get around that, then go for it but the other ""online"" free trial they offer is just as good and you won't loose anything ). Like my Outlook 2007 review, this was a real treat for me and worth the price .. which again WAS LOWEST AT AMAZON, by a LOT. WORD, POWERPOINT, ONE NOTE (A Really Cool Feature!) .. all of it is great. If you need Office capabilities but can't afford the REALLY nice stuff, this works just fine. You will be happy with your purchase.",0
"As an infrequent casual photographer who finds the inclination to pull out one of the cameras for special events or vacation trips necessitating a review of the cameras capabilities in the car or plane on the way to venue and then worrying about the results achieved once I transfer the pics to a laptop, this package is just about the perfect triage package for me.  That said, so would be Adobe Elements or for that matter, based on how much I require of any photo editing software, Roxio Creator NXT.

And, thats somewhat of the point. While the stand alone products I have used all contain more robust complements of utilities to manipulate the subject media, more often than not after dabbling for a while in the attempt to understand the capabilities of the application I ended up using a pretty typical core group of features and forgetting how to quickly and efficiently employ the more sophisticated features, finding myself often frustrated with the need to reacquaint myself with the software in order to reach some crest of achievement.

 As an infrequent user, there are a wealth of image editing and adjustment features and utilities that are reasonably user friendly as well as a catalog of significantly more sophisticated functions that are available for users with greater skill sets and requisite needs. If I elect to step up my game, I am not constricted by a software package  that will not accommodate my improvement and equally as important to me, is a product with a one-time cost (even if I don't really own any more than I own any software) versus a virtual payday loan package.",0

"I have used H&R Blocks tax program for many years and have always been happy with it.  This year is no exception.  It works great on my mac.  My taxes are complicated because I have rental properties (and in the past my own business as well)--but it makes preparing my taxes a breeze---and way cheaper than hiring someone.

You can choose to import data or enter all data manually.  I actually enter mine in manually as that is my preference.  (actually, to clarify, i import previous years taxes but manually enter w-2s, charitable contribution, rental income and expenses, etc)

This includes 5 free federal efiles (which isn't as good, in my opinion, as when it included 1 state and 1 federal).  The state program is included with this but if you want to efile you have to pay for that.

For anyone that has to pay state taxes in addition to federal, it is great to have the two programs.  Essentially, the state taxes are filled out by the time you get done with the federal--with the exception of a few questions that you have to answer.  You can always purchase the state later rather than getting them together, however, i have found that it is more expensive to do it that way.

If you haven't used tax software before or are new to this brand---it is super duper easy to use.  They have questions and you fill in the blanks.  You can get more information and help with any topic you need.  You can also get the actual publication information from the IRS.  Tax preparation may sound intimidating, but with a program like this it is very simple.

With H&R block you also get access to a tax advisor for free (for 1 issue)--which can be helpful and is an advantage of this vs. other brands.

In addition you get audit assistance with this if you efile--although hopefully you will never need it.

Even if you have difficult taxes, don't be scared to try this product before going to a professional.  You will most likely find that it is much easier than you think.  And H&R block offers a money back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose.

Updates are free and essentially automatic--it does ask you permission to update--but that is pretty much the extent of it.

For safety purposes I always back up my taxes to a CD AND load the tax software and my taxes on a second computer--perhaps a bit neurotic but i'd rather be safe.  It is extremely easy to do back ups.  Also, I have several years of taxes loaded onto my computer and when i switched from primarily PC's to primarily MACs i was able to transfer all of my taxes over without a problem or hassle.

Because you get 5 free efiles, you can do your friends taxes if you want to be nice.  I always register the product in my name but usually do 4 different returns.  You can also choose to print and file returns if you would like also.

Another feature I like is that i can do ""what if"" scenarios--i will go in and change numbers to see how it effects  my taxes so i can better estimate for future years.

H&R Block also will give you tips/warnings/suggestions if there are any red flags or errors on your return.

UPDATE:  as of 2/22 I have successfully efiled  3 federal and state returns.  i did not have any issues with efiling at all.  although, i realized i made an error earlier in this review because when i went to file, i realized you get audit support if you efile or paper file--as long as you used the program to help you on your taxes.",0
"My wife bought and used virtually every Family Tree Maker edition for many years up until the time she passed away in 2004. Before FTM she used PAF. I used earlier versions of FTM a few times, but I never even approached the level she did. A few days ago I installed Family Tree Maker 2012 Premium after I finally located the backup disks from over eight years ago. The 2012 FTM software loaded the old database and converted it flawlessly. To my amazement, there were over 19,750 names and just over 7000 families in her database! It will be fairly straightforward to add another 250 names to hit the 20,000 mark.

It took me a short while to learn how to use the new software and make updates, but only a few hours. I found it more intuitive than Version 8. Since I never used Version 8 very much, others might have a different opinion. I did a trial and error approach to learning, but finally had to resort to the manual. There is a relatively thick FTM book that came with the software, but I found it easier to just make a Google search on the specific topic I wanted to know.  And I was able to find answers to the topics every time with almost no effort. The step by step illustrated instructions are very good.

I made some updates to my wife's database and signed up for the Ancestry.com 6 month free trial. Then I uploaded the entire database to the Ancestry website.  Then the Ancestry web site found several other FTM databases that compared to branches on my family tree. There were a few minor differences, but I was absolutely delighted how accurate my wife's tree information was. Of course, I still have some refinements to make.  I admit that I never would have done so much research to create such an extensive tree structure dating back over 600 years. I'm just thankful I was able to finally recover all her hard work.

You can add extensive notes and link photos, citations and many other things to any individual in the database. It has provisions for multiple marriages and children to the relevant spouse. But it will only display one spouse at a time. It allows you to pick a preferred default spouse. I wish it would display the full tree without being required to select each spouse separately. It has a provision to show foster children's families and name changes, but I have not tried to do that.  I read about it while I was learning some other things.

The performance seems very good in spite of the size of the database I have, but I am using a fast Intel i7 CPU based system with lots of RAM and two solid state disks - one for the operating system and one for the FTM files. But I think it will perform well on most modern computers. Before I installed the new FTM software, I installed Version 8 on a computer that is definitely not high speed with the same large database file. That computer handled it just fine.

The Platinum version is the one to buy. The six month free subscription to Ancestry.com is well worth the difference in price. There is a gold mine of information on Ancestry.com that can link up and compare to your own family tree saving you countless hours of research.  Without the Ancestry link, you would be wasting so much time trying to do everything by yourself. Very likely your family tree is already on Ancestry.com to some degree, perhaps back even hundreds of years.

I don't understand the picky points some people make about this product and the low scores. I'm sure they may have a very technical point to make, but it doesn't warrant anything less than 4 stars. For the average user, this is superb software and a welcome addition to any family. I strongly recommend this excellent software.",0

Bought HRBlock Deluxe for 2014 (Mac CD version) after using Turbotax for several years and Taxcut before that.  I shifted over to HRBlock (used to be Taxcut) after reading many Turbtax reviews that you can no longer use TT Deluxe for Sched D efiling for the 2014 version. TT requires you to buy TT Premier at a cost that is 2x that of HRBlock Deluxe.  I found HRBlock excellent and installed on my Mac quickly without problems.  It imported last year Turbotax files as well as Quicken for Mac 2015 files without error. I found HR Block easier to use and the import was more complete than Turbtax (TT) deluxe.  I am very happy with the shift to HRBlock. All of my fears of shifting tax software were unfounded. TT has gotten greedy and others should consider letting the market send a loud no buy message to Intuit (TT parent).  After using HRBlock I probably would not shift back to TT even if they dropped their price and made thier Deluxe version with the same features as their 2013 product.  I have found HRBlock to be an excellent product and accurate. I obviously have not yet tested the efiling portion of the program but I am assuming no glitches.  But the easy navigation allowed me to do a draft tax return in half the time as last years TurboTax (TT).  I highly recommend this product especially for former TT users.,0
"This being the third generation of Apple's UNIX-based OS X operating system shows refinement and attention to detail.
The greatest proof is the invisibility of the Unix underpinnings. Even administrator tasks can be handled with ease. There are an abundance of setup utilities (""wizards"") and familiar system preferences (like control panels.)
The Macintosh has always meant simplicity, ease of use, powerful utility and just plain fun. Panther continues the tradition and enhances the experience.
Should you upgrade? Panther works for all G4 & G5 based Macs and MANY G3 systems. (PowerBook G3 Wallstreet and original PowerBook G3, G3 Beige and some other G3 systems are excluded from the supported systems list.) Essentially any G3 or higher Mac with built-in USB is supposedly supported. Panther has proven to be extremely stable. If you have a G5, Panther is almost essential to keep you up-to-date with all the hardware features and fixes becoming available.
If you have a G4, you PROBABLY want to get the upgrade to be sure to get the latest enhancements and fixes. Many of the graphical improvements require high-end graphic cards to see the benefit, though.
If you have a G3, first check to be sure your system is supported. Go to the Apple.com web page and select the ""Mac OS X"" tab. Then click on the ""Upgrade"" tab then select the link for ""Check the system requirements"". If your system passes muster, you may want to consider Panther because of the latest updates. You probably won't notice too many speed improvements or enhanced graphics capabilities. However, since it is a stable upgrade and has a number of useful new features it is worth considering.
If you have Internet access, getting updates is as simple as launching ""Software Updates"" from the Apple menu. There are many new features, outlined in the Amazon review and detailed at the Apple web site, ""Mac OS X"" tab, ""New Features"" tab.
For me, my favorite new features are Expos and Fast User Switching. With Expos, hit one function key and all your open windows slide aside so you can see your desktop. Hit a different key and all windows are visble, in miniature and aligned. Click on one of them and it pops to the top of the heap.
Fast user switching allows two (or more) separate users to use the same Mac at the same time. Each gets his/her own desktop and preferences. Select a user name from a new users menu at the top, right of the menu bar and enter that user's password and poof, your desktop becomes the other user's desktop. One user can log out and the other user can keep going. This is a real boon because both my wife and I are Mac addicts and still need to share one Mac (after all, isn't sharing what marriage is about?)
Overall, I feel Panther is a worthwhile upgrade, but the price may be prohibitive to some.",0

"I get so many online viruses, and I really don't do anything but homework, email and facebook (and I don't do FB apps at all), so I'm not sure where all this malware was coming from, but I was getting so extremely frustrated and my McAfee wasn't helping to be sure not my Windows security at all!  I got the Kaspersky about a month ago and installed it right away in one computer, just so I could keep a fair comparison, even though I really wanted to do it in both!  I use both computers daily, one at home, my laptop for school, my laptop is the one I did not install it yet (and in fairness at school it is pretty well protected by the schools security interface).  So far the difference at home has been amazing though!  Not a ONE malware has made it through, and I am talking at least daily attempts and weekly hackings, thats how bad the malware was making it, and when I am at home on my laptop it is still pretty bad so I can't wait to install Kaspersky to this one as well!  Highly recommended, so much safer than McAfee, which as far as I can see doesn't do anything for malware which has always been MY biggest problem!  I also love that this is good for three computers per year, I myself have 2 (so I could share with someone), but McAfee I had to buy per computer (when I just got my new computers I think I got a year with one Dell and 3 months with another), but I like that Kaspersky also understands most homes have more than one pc and doesn't charge you per each!",0
"Installed the Lantronix USB device server in 10 minutes, just connected to ethernet, installed software, and plugged in devices. I am using it with an epson scanner and an HP Officejet K60- which is supposed to be (acording to hp) non-compatible with a wireless network. I bought this with the expectation it probably wouldn't work with the HP but it did! wireless connection is great- entire network has full control over devices on other side of house, 2 ports left for any other devices I wish to network, couldn't be happier this product was worth the price for me.

Update: When DSL signal is low or reset, device server sometimes needs to be reconnected or reset as well - usually this is just a matter of disconnecting power and usb devices then reconnecting but sometimes pressing the pinhole reset button is required. It can be annoying but it's mostly attributed to my poor dsl signal, other than that still works great, still highly recommend!",0

Also, if you haven't previously used the Quicken mobile app for tracking your spending with your mobile device, you will quickly learn to love this feature with the improvements in 2015.

"Bottom-Line: Microsoft continues to improve its premiere messaging application; for me ""Outlook 2010"" is (still) the contact management program for me and remains the best on the market, period!

So, I have been working with Microsoft Office 2010 for the last seven or so months on three different computer platforms all running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.  I use ""Microsoft Outlook 2010"" every day; it is one of the first applications I open in the morning and one of the last I close in the evening, so I am very familiar with the program and it functionality.

""Outlook 2010"" (the software can also be purchased separately), is the (Office) suite's business and personal communications/collaboration client for connecting to Microsoft Exchange, or external Internet based POP3 email providers like Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Gmail, etc.

But, ""Outlook 2010"" is also a very robust (stand-a-lone) contact manager allowing one  to schedule meeting, create a To-Do Task List, keep track of Contacts, create Notes, and keep a running record of documents and emails sent and or received via Outlook Journal.  From very humble beginnings, Microsoft has turned Outlook into the must-have Contact Manager.

The first thing you'll notice about ""Outlook 2010"" is the new multi-colored splash screen on startup. This new yellow, orange, and red splash screen is common across all other Office Products as well.  But the (rounded) splash screen also relays information about what the product is doing during the load process; not that anyone will understand the verbiage.  But, for techies like me it looks cool!

Once ""Outlook 2010"" starts you will be greeted with a much smoother user interface with much smoother fonts and edges, as well as a more subtle color theme and an operational ribbon bar transplanted from the rest of the Office Suite.  Anyone familiar with Office 2007 will be right at home with the new Ribbon motif in Outlook 2010; Outlook 2007 was not so adorned.

All of the menu items in previous versions of Outlook have been moved to the Ribbon along with many new tasks/options.  All of these changes blend in nicely with Microsoft's upcoming Windows 7 operating system, but might take some getting used to for those not familiar with the Office Ribbon Bar.

Overall the layout of the interface remains unchanged from that of Outlook 2007.  However, the Inbox and the Sent Items Folder has been moved to the top of the folder list in the Folder List View, while there is more space between the folders.  User created mailbox folders are now pushed down below the Default Outlook Folders.  Nothing too radical, but the new Inbox location took me a little getting used to.

What Else is New?

64-Bit Performance: Perhaps the largest change to Office 2010 suite is the availability of both a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the suite.  This of course translates to better memory and processor usage, resulting in better performance throughout.

Conversation view has been added to Outlook 2010 much to the delight of fans of third-party email clients like Gmail. If an e-mail comes in that's a reply to the original message, any related messages to that particular subject line are displayed with it.  The default view is collapsed, but all of the messages in the conversation string, including the original sent mail and replies, can be displayed with a simple click of the mouse.

Forwarding a message as an attachment or Text Message now has a home in the form of a designated button(s) on the (Respond) section on the Home tab of the ribbon bar. Click on the button and a new email comes up with the selected message already as an attachment. Note: this feature will also work with multiple messages.  Note: in order to send a Text Message, you'll need to set up the service first.

Quick Steps is a fantastic new feature in ""Outlook 2010.""  Outlook Quick Steps--accessible via the Quick Steps section of the Home Ribbon bar--allow you to create shortcuts for various actions like automatically replying to a selected message and deleting, and or filing the original, or forwarding a message to a specific person, group of people, or even department.  And quick steps can even be assigned keyboard shortcuts.  Outlook 2010 includes a number of default Quick Steps, and new ones are very easy to create.

Voice-Mail Integration is now offered with Outlook 2010 and is used in conjunction with Exchange 2010 and Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 R2.  This feature creates an easy to use multi-media interface for playing back voice-mail messages.

HTML Rending Issues

Microsoft first started using Word to render the HTML content in Outlook 2007.
Microsoft has kept MS Word as the rending engine for creating HTML e-mails much to the chagrin of a large number of users who complain that Microsoft should a more industry standard engine.  MS Word, they say, does an incomplete job of rendering HTML graphics and text and a highly caustic campaign has been started via a website called Fixoutlook.org and is being supported by the Email Standards Project. The campaign claims to have more than 19,000 participants.

But Microsoft recently reaffirmed that is plans to move ahead with Word as the rendering engine in ""Outlook 2010.""  This was confirmed in a recent BLOG post by William Kennedy, Microsoft's Corporate VP for Office Communications and Forms.

Kennedy wrote ""Word has always done a great job of displaying the HTML which is commonly found in e-mails around the world. For e-mail viewing, Word also provides security benefits that are not available in a browser. Word cannot run web script or other active content that may threaten the security and safety of our customers.""

He went on to state: ""the 'Email Standards Project' does not represent a sanctioned standard or an industry consensus in this area. Should such a consensus arise, we will of course work with other e-mail vendors to provide rich support in our products.""

Personally, I have never had a problem creating or displaying HTML messages in Outlook 2007, nor have I had an issue with Outlook 2010 thus far, so I cannot relate.

Enough said.

My Thoughts

""Outlook 2010"" as a standalone application does not represent a huge a huge leap forward in the areas of contact management, Email communications, or scheduling.  But, when integrated with MS Exchange 2010 and MS OCS 2007, the program offers a wealth of new functionality in an enterprise setting.  Although the interface may look the same as Outlook 2007, this faade is somewhat deceptive, because underneath the skin lies a swift new program able to speak in 32, or 64-Bit computing.

However, despite the robust enterprise pedigree Outlook 2010 is perfectly fine for the standalone user, and or small office setting utilizing POP3 or HTML based mail.  The ability to install and run the 64-Bit version of the software is incentive enough for me to want to trade-up.  And while some may find the new Ribbon Bar intimidating (hey even I had to get used to it), given time it will prove a time-saver.  HTML rendering aside, Microsoft continues to improve its premiere messaging application; for me ""Outlook 2010"" is (still) the contact management program for me and remains the best on the market, period!",0

I can't re-download it for some reason to my backup laptop (it won't let me even though I still have my registration code) that I keep at my parent's house so I decided to get one of the Open Source suites. I tried Apache first and it wasn't that good. Lots of issues with the word processing - the main program I use - so I uninstalled Apache and downloaded this suite - LibreOffice v4.3 for PC.

AMAZING! Works just like Word in every way and you can open Libre documents in Word and vice versa. The suite is also compatible with Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. I was surprised to learn that a lot of companies use and support Libre Open Office suite as their regular suite. Think about how cost effective this is for everyone. I guess I won't be buying Microsoft Office again. Ever.

With the word processing program, I can create documents for reviews and then paste them right into the review form on Amazon with no problem. I can also transfer text into word documents easily. It's perfect. Publisher is also pretty amazing too.

Highly recommend.",1
"The service pack updates to Vista make a world of difference, finally letting this OS shine.",0
Years ago I owed what I think was the first version of this product and it didn't work very well.  This product however works really well.  The menus are a bit confusing but as far as tracking goes this is a good product.  I  used it while on a trip along side my Magellean GPS and it compared well.  The PC version is a little slower than the standalone GPS but it is a nice alternative to buying a more expensive GPS.  Another pro is you have a bigger view of the map and can zoom in and out.,0
"I have been using this for over a month. It is very fast and starts up quickly, and screen is especially pleasing to the eye.",0
This modem is just GREAT!  I still use dial-up and this more than fits the bill (much faster than my old modem).  It was very easy to install on my new home built computer that uses Vista Home Premium. I have been using it for about a month now and have had no problems. Thank You Amazon.com for the great service you gave me and I will definitely be using you again for future purchases.,0
I needed to upgrade in order to prepare to go back to school.  So far I still have to learn a lot more about the software so I have to get the book.  I would recommend this to those that have at least an intermediate level of computer knowledge - this is definitely not for novice computer users.,0
I thought this to be very inexpensive for all that we got.  Great for the you boys for their computer center in our home school.,0
"Best reviews of any Anti-Virus out there. I concur. Low CPU load and it does everything. Optimize, clean and backup. Updates are pulsed, quick and ocurr everytime you go on line. I haven't had any infections since using 360. Good advanced features (for moderate user). Set it and forget it. Gotta love it. BUT...only buy through Amazon, best price by far. Renew by buying at Amazon again.  Highly reccomended.",0
"I have used System Mechanic for a few years and it seems to really help out my older computer running XP. It is faster, less prone to lockups or crashes, and keeps the junk off my hard drive. It scans my computer automatically and tunes it up. Periodically, I run the scan and fixes manually. I believe it keeps my older computer running better than it did without this fine program. Great Program and the price is right!",0
"As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios.",0
Worked as designed,0

"Purchased this for a new commputer that came without this software.  I use Outlook for my Calendar and to sync with my Blackberry. Like most MS software it's over priced, however I'm used to it and could transfer my old computer data to it easily.

"While most of our experience has already been documented here by other customers, we still wanted to take the opportunity to rave about this addition to the Rosetta Stone family. Both ""my other half"" and I have used Rosetta Stone in the past. We both constructed a foundation for Japanese using these products (and then reinforced it with an intermediate college class). Likewise, as a professor, I was able to test the Rosetta Stone English series. I was astonished at how very intuitive the software was (and the manner in which it integrated the best approaches to ESL that I knew). Therefore, when we spotted this new reading product, we were very hopeful.

As always, Rosetta Stone's years of expertise are evident in this reading package. Like all Rosetta Stone software, the experience never feels like ""work"" for the little ones. And, while the price seems a little heavy, do know that the there are fifty individual exercise and a vast array of activities. All are age appropriate, child-friendly, and rendered in lovely detail. Every single aspect of this program (which you may find your child referring to as a ""game"" ... which is ideal!) encourages literacy BUT in a truly exciting, delightful manner.

We encountered no bugs. This has clearly been closely beta-tested.

Finally, we also love that this software encourages the positive, educational use of technology. Denying children technology isn't pragmatic ... it leaves them at a significant disadvantage when they begin formal schooling. Therefore, this offers yet one more outstanding experience for young ones.

Everything about this software is carefully created, family friendly, and deeply educational. Do not hesitate to invest this new Rosetta Stone reading package.",0
"I have had Dreamweaver MX2004 since it came out back then. Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.

The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.

I'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.
At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version. So I recommend it.",0

"I have been using this product without a hiccough for almost six months, including the beta, and there is no reason to shop for another product.

This security tool handles all your Windows machine needs, including:

--Virus protection

--Firewall

--Spyware (in conjunction with Windows Defender, downloaded automatically for free during the installation of OneCare)

--Machine performance tuning (disk defragmentation, missing updates)

--Backups (provided, of course, you have something to backup to...)

--Automatic Windows updates

As compared to other products, the memory and CPU footprint is smaller, freeing up resources to do other things.

Unlike certain other products, it does not act like a giant billboard attempting to get you to buy more software from the maker.

A single purchase at what appears to be an on-going $19.99 sale price provides protection for up to three machines for less than any of the major vendors charge for just anti-virus software for one machine.

I see no good reason not to purchase this product, but there are a few bad reasons:

--If you are not using real Windows software, you will not be able to use this product, so if you bought a machine 5 years ago and had the neighbor's 13 year old kid install the Windows XP he downloaded from the Internet, don't bother.  If you are not sure, try visiting the Microsoft site and follow the links to validate your software.

--As someone pointed out in another review, you will need to register at MSN.  This is no big deal, and does nothing other than give an email address to Microsoft (just like McAfee, Norton, and everyone else does for registration of their software).  This account is used to track how many machines you are using the software on, and given the rampant software theft problems in the world, makes perfect sense.  If you are paranoid that the most successful software company in the world plans to violate anti-spam legislation, just make up an email address.

In summary, forget the competition, forget the ""I hate Microsoft"" zealots, and get some inexpensive, quality security software for your PC.",0
"Windows Xp is by far the best operating system to ever come out of Microsoft.
- Increased speed, You will notice a 10-15 percent increase in speed when starting applications, doing simple tasks like cutting and pasting large files, Boot time has at least cut in half from previous windows os
- Increaed security, If you are a 95, 98, or ME user you are using the fat32 file system. NTFS is a much more advantaced and secure file system
- Increased Stability, Tried of the dreded blue screen? No more with xp. I have tried to crash my xp system and it just doesn't happen. No more hitting the switch because your system freezes, and no more scandisk (which is a tribute to the better ntfs file system)
- Multiple Users, Windows Xp makes it unbeliveibly easy to manage differnet users. You can set up as many different users as you want with almost no effort. It also has the ability to ""fast switch"" users so you can logoff and someone else can log on, but when you come back anything you were working on, or windows that you had open are still there!
Also the added security makes your files invisible to other users but it allows you to share your files with other, like pictures or music very easily
- Hardware Support, I was surprised to see someone complaining about xp not surrporting their hardware, This operating system supports the most amount of hardware from printers to network cards than any other operating system i have ever seen. And i have used amost all different types of operating systems that you can think of from linux to bsd.
- The help and support feature is a huge upgrade from any previous os. It is extremely easy to use and includes some of the most common problems or tasks right there for you to use. It can also go onlin on the microsoft site and grab possible answers to your question from there making it almost impossible to not find the answer to your problems. Xp also has a built in remote desktop feature so that you can invite a computer geek friend to connect to your computer and control remotely to help you with your problem. (you can also connect to microsofts help and support and allow them to remotely troubleshoot your system)
- Digital Hub, Windows xp is much more robust when it comes to digital photos and music allowing you to view your photots in different ways and even order prints right from your pictures folder!
As a previous Windows ME user i was pretty mad at Microsoft for releasing such a bad operating system, but they redemed themselves with the release of XP. If you are thinking of upgrading than do it. You will be happy.",0

"As an amateur photographer I enjoy noodling around with various photo editing software and have used several iterations of Photoshop Elements, Paintshop Pro, and Lightroom.  Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is new to me and I must say I was immediately impressed by some of the features.

For one thing, Photo Director didn't try to grab and re-catalog every picture file on my hard drive as some other programs do.  It allowed me to select the photos I want to open.

PhotoDirector didn't balk when opening CR2 files (Canon RAW).  With some other packages, I've had to open and convert my RAW files to JPGs in the camera's software before the software would open with them for further editing.  Since that's a non-issue with PhotoDirector it saves a lot of time.

PhotoDirector includes a lot of editing features; some are standard in photo editing packages (Tooth Brush, Eye Blinger), others were new to me (Body Shaping). I found the separation of Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover helped with control and produced a less ""plastic"" looking result.  I like the Content Aware Removal and Smart Patch, but these are two areas that are going to require some practice by the user. I also like the Watermark Creator and WaterMark Templates that are included.  If you're a social media user, you can save and upload a photo to Facebook from PhotoDirector. If you're into HDR photography, you can bracket up to 5 shots with PhotoDirector.

Any photo editing software that does this much has a learning curve, especially if you're used to another package.  So, I was also impressed that the PhotoDirector 5 package included a 117 page manual in the box, including a list of hot key shortcuts.  There is also a handy Help link that is both indexed and searchable so you can figure out how to accomplish an effect while you're working.

What I like most about PhotoDirector is that it does some of the things I commonly need with my photo editing, but have been switching between other programs to accomplish - opening and preliminary editing of RAW files with camera software, to basic clean up and editing with PS Elements, to Watermark and Slideshow with Lightroom.  For basic needs, PhotoDirector has simplified my work flow.

Professional photographers will want to go the PhotoShop / Lightroom direction, but PhotoDirector is great for people who want to do simple editing for personal use (family photos, Facebook, etc.).",0

"The progress is low-priced video editing programs over the past few years is nothing less than astounding. Originally, Corel acquired what has become VideoStudio Pro X2 from Ulead. Ulead's products were always ambitious and often too quirky to use. In this case, Corel has tamed the base product and turned out a very usable video editing and DVD authoring package that compares very favorably with the stalwart Adobe Premiere Elements.

  One big advantage packed into the VideoStudio Pro  X2 box is a manual, a real manual!  While the 200+ page manual will not teach you the art of editing, it will most certainly walk you through, albeit briefly in most cases, eery significant feature of the program. It's a matter of opinion, but I think old-fashioned ink on paper is still the best way to rapidly convey information. Kudos to Corel for including the manual, something Adobe doesn't bother to do.

  And there is a lot to learn  about VideoStudio Pro X2. This is no lightweight editing program: it can do (within reason) anything you need done by way of video capture, editing and output.

  Video capture options include DV tape and AVCHD.

  You start with three video and three audio tracks, a lot for a product in this price range. You can add up to five overlay tracks, which is actually a staggering number for a consumer oriented package. You can, of course, add effects, filters, overlays and titles. There is an abundance of trimming and cutting tools, which you can apply on the frame level.

  The list of things you can do, as a matter of fact, is quite extensive and you will be glad to have that 200+ page manual to work with as you learn the program.

  The work area is quite nice and you can change the view to meet your needs and desires.

  You can create your own animations with a painting tool, generate your own titles, edit audio complete with a mixing panel.

  Output options are surprisingly rich. DVDs with menus, of course, the now ubiquitous YouTube uploader, write to DV tape and export to mobile device.

  For those of us who have roots in the days of editing film with the then conventional tools, VideoStudio Pro X2 with its low price and broaqd usability is breathtaking. In comparison with other contemporary consumer editing programs, though, it is a contender for best of breed.

  Overall, it represents excellent value and a comprehensive toolkit for turning your raw video into a finished product.

"PhotoDirector Ultra is a very valuable addition to your picture editing software. The only criticism I can make of this handsomely outfitted program is that it will allow you to import photos in JEPG, TIFF and RAW but not PNG. Many of my images, which are stored in my picture editor ACDSee, are in PNG format because of PNG's lossless data compression. Many of my images are big because they eventually go on tee shirts or posters but need to be uploaded to my company in condensed form. It is a simple matter to convert the images to JEPG before sending them to  PhotoDirector, but I wish this step was not necessary.

The software works with Windows 7. Windows 8, Vista and XP 32 bit, but with XP Service Pack 3 is required. It supports Mac OS. The 350 MB package downloaded to my Windows 7 Ultimate without a hitch. In a single package you can organize your photos, adjust, edit and share. The editors say PhotoDirector exceeds the capabilities of PhotoShop Lightroom.

The five PhotoDirector Modules appear at the top of your canvas.

Library- where your imported photos will be stored. While in the library your images can be sorted by tagging them, plunking them into a smart collection, album or folder.

Adjustments- this is a fine playpen where you can whip your photo into shape and plug and play. Instant views of your adjustments can be seen by running your mouse over the thumbnails of imported Images at the bottom of your canvas. All of the adjustments are on your left. Tones, brightness and subtle tinges, red eye, cropping, the application of presets and literally hundreds of face lifts can be applied to your photos. Sliders can be manipulated to zero in on exactly the effect that you want. An HDR (high dynamic range) selection allows you to apply brilliant color to an image.

Edit- here you apply makeover tools to your portraits. Zapping wrinkles, smoothing skin, re-shaping an out of shape bod will make you popular with your friends whose pictures you manipulate. The Eye Blinger lets you brighten eyes, darken lashes and eyebrows and much more via special brushes. Watermarks can also be applied from this module and are created here, too.

Slideshow- Slideshows are created here and can be accompanied by music and exported to UTube if you wish. The booklet that is included with PhotoDirector  explains how to do this. All of the modules are covered in this Users Guide and explained with easy to follow directions.

Print- here you can customize the layout, and the way images are displayed and more by zooming, rotating and other maneuvers.

PhotoDirector4 Ultra has a lot to offer for the money. You can download it as a trial to see if it's for you. I am very comfortable with this software and look forward to generating some exciting images. When you design tee shirts, you have to be pretty exciting or you sink fast. My tee shirt company posts 150,000 products A DAY. It's a jungle out there!",0
"This program is a great way to learn a language. The method of using pictures with the text helps you make associations and learn much faster,easier and more fun than just memorizing words. You do need to be self motivated but I found myself looking forward to the lessons. The program will automatically recommend to repeat a lesson if you make too many errors. I love that you can have up to 5 users so others can learn along with you and that makes it a good value for households that have several members who would like to learn the language. I think it would also be a good family activity/project and learning with others would be great for motivation and practice. The audio companion CDs are a big help to reinforce and practice what you have learned.
I had no problems with the software installation and set up except for some reason the software could not detect my wireless connection and I had to register by phone.",0
Excellent product worked without a problem.,1
"First, let me just say to those that already don't know:  Before even thinking about buying this, visit Norton's website and download a 15-day trial, to see if it works well with your system.

It seems to me that Norton 360 is a program with a huge ego:  If installed on a new clean, freshly-reformatted PC, it will serve you well.  As advertised, these are the features you get with the pacakge:

Antivirus
Antispyware
Email scanning
Antiphishing
Rootkit detection
Identity protection
Web site authentication
Network monitoring
Firewall protection
Automatic backup and restore
2GB secured online storage
PC performance tuneups
Automatic updates*
Embedded support
Optional antispam and parental controls

One aspect that I noticed is its no longer a system hog like it used to be.  It even scans, defragments and mantains your system while your computer is idle.

However, if your machine is no longer in the ""new, fresh"" state, get ready to face some problems.  It seems like it complicates things with other utility programs that may have already be installed on your machine(thats why I said ""Big Ego."")

I had problems with Norton 360 when I installed it on a PC that was reformatted half a year ago and it didn't run too well: freezing, hang-ups and Live Update complete stopped working.  It was also difficult to uninstall.

However, on a newly bought PC it worked pretty smoothly so far with no complications.

But don't take my word for it.  PC Magazine has an extensive review on it.  EDIT:  Amazon took the link off...I guess we're not allowed to post 3rd party links.  However, if you google ""Norton 360 review"" it will be one of the top links.",0

If you have an SSL error, make sure to completely turn off Kaspersky and then try again.  Once you resolve the error, simply re-start Kaspersky.

"While I purchase and install MS Office Pro on my computers, I still use Word Perfect and Quattro Pro for my primary word processing and spread sheet software.  Word Perfect is best of class, in my opinion.  The ""reveal codes"" feature, something I don't think MS Word has ever offered, can be very helpful when working with a large and complex document.  Corel also does a good job of allowing you to save your document into other formats... so compatibility with many other word processors is very good.",0
"I knew this was just a key card and I had to download it, so I was surprised that it arrived in a ""box"".  The box wasn't that big, and no major harm.

The card gives you a URL to visit to download Office, and then you enter your activation key during installation. The download was easy and activation was easy. I installed this on my 2015 Macbook (Retina) and had no issues with performance or functionality.

My job is 100% using Google collaboration tools, and it's all web based. You'd think that I wouldn't need MS Office anymore, but in fact a lot of stuff still comes in in office format, and it's helpful to have an offline option when I'm traveling or on an airplane where there is no internet.

The nice thing about this package as opposed to a 365 subscription:

1.  It doesn't involve a subscription and doesn't expire
2.  The price is right
3.  Install is simple & straight forward

"OK, written as a ""first reviewer but still reviewing"" I'm wiped out by the FINALLY open PC apps that this is running without any problems, but I'm pushin' it.

Run windows -finally- well while running OS X, but you'll require a newer, faster Intel-based Apple for speed ad stamina.  A bit slower on the startup but expected. for me, running Windows apps from work at home is a very big deal, and here we are, running fine.

I've received emails from people moving up from an earlier version of VMware but really, no problems on my new MB at all, but sooner or later, I push 'em and I'll certainly rewrite any review if and when I find a fatal flaw.

Using add-ons like the GPS system I use but relied on my wife's laptop PC for is now under my control.
Using some of the photo priniting stuff that kodak made that works so well on her PC runs on my MB. so far, so good.

"AutoCAD is the industry standard in drafting programs and the ""LT 2011"" version is a good choice for those who will not need to work in 3D. While my background is a little weak in this area, my Engineering Major nephew was kind enough to give me some help coming up to speed with this excellent program since he used it both in school and at his intern position, which greatly reduced the learning curve! Here are my observations:

Installation: We loaded this on a fairly powerful Compaq laptop running Windows 7 and had no issues. This was very easy to install and each step of installation had a help tab that led you to the online help center if you had any questions

Intuitiveness of controls: This program makes it very easy to get started with 2D applications and the many useful features and tools are well though out. After learning the basics, it became obvious that there might actually be too many tools (more than are likely to be ever used for my needs)

Tutorials: Includes 3 short video demos that are very basic but help you get your bearings, which I highly recommend novice users take the time to watch

In program help tool: While a nice option to have, they can often be somewhat less than useful if you don't already understand the basics

Online help center: The real gem of the ""Help"" options comes from the Online Help Center! It is very helpful with many of the more difficult topics covered, has video aids, and is overall very comprehensive

Honestly this is likely more program than I really need for our small business designing and making molds, but it more than covers what I want it to do. It is very specifically streamlined for making blueprints but is likely useful for many other similar applications.

Highly Recommended!

I've used Quicken for 15 years and bought iBank4 now that Lion won't run Quicken (so I am told). It downloaded my files correctly. I love the interface. It is fast and the reports are excellent. Much nicer that Quicken. I'm running both Quicken for Mac 2007 and iBank4 in parallel until Lion comes out next month. Even if Quicken does run under Lion I'll probably dump it.,0

"I have used TaxCut for at least 10 years.  This year's H&R Block version seems a smooth transition from the last couple years.  I have not done my taxes yet, so I have not encountered any problems.  If I do I will return and update this review.  I did notice in the reviews that some people had troubles in downloading the state edition (VA in my case).  I had no problem downloading and installing the VA program.  Since last year my computer got a virus which required me to erase everything and reload. All my data was backed up on a external drive.  However, I did want to look at my 2008 return on my computer so I reloaded the 2088 TaxCut and updated it with no problem.  Then I downloaded the VA state version for 2008 which went very smoothly.  So far everything is working fine.  Last year I did have a problem with the updates which required me to get tech support from H&R Block which worked very well.

As an aside, I worked for a year as an H&R Block tax preparer and was shocked to learn their program in the office was nothing like TaxCut.  It was very difficult to learn and to use.  Of course, it was very powerful, but a pain.  Even when I worked in the H&R Block office I continued using TaxCut for ours and our children & mother-in-law returns.",0
"I have always had good luck with McAfee products, and although the founder of the company is now being sought as a murder suspect, it doesn't mean his software is not solid.

I have two home computers, and the multi-user feature worked well.  I was able to install and run auto-updates no problem.

"Before now, I hadn't used Norton Internet Security in about 5 years. I decided to stop using it because it was simply more trouble than it was worth. It was basically nothing more than an obtrusive, bloated, system-slowing annoyance. And to be honest, I only gave Norton Internet Security another shot and began using it again because I was able to acquire it for free. Well, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this 2014 version because it is nothing like the last version of Norton Internet Security I tried. It now has a very long and impressive list of features and protections, and since installing this 2014 version I've noticed no increase in boot time, I've noticed no slowing of my system, and it basically just runs in the background with very little required interaction. Among many other things, Norton claims this version will actively protect you against viruses, spam, spyware, identity theft, and social media dangers, and so far it's given me no reason to believe it's not doing that. And that's exactly what I want/expect from an internet security program. I want it to do its job, do it well, and leave me alone as much as possible. I've had this 2014 version installed for about a month now, and so far I'm impressed and very happy with it. Give this 2014 version a try and I'm fairly certain you will be, too.",0

"Hello, Says it can make my laptop run faster. I tried it and it did. It claims it is easy to use. Yes, it is easy to use. It claims it won't make a mess of my laptop. Right again. I used the easy button and believe the claims the developer made are accurate. UPDATE I installed this on my 64bit OS and soon received a message from the developer informing me that I need to discontinue Win cleaner on the 64bit OS. Due to reports of inflicting damage to the OS. I've been attributing the 64bit OS problems to MS updater loading the AMD 64 drivers on to my desktop w/Intel processor. Side Note...MS is really getting to be pain in my butt! UPDATE Wincleaner is a type of software that gets well...stolen. My KAV burned me and I in the end nuke the drive. I asked the software developer if I could have another shot at loading the software because unlike modern software that has the ability to recognize that it is back on the same computer (FAIR USE CLAWS) this software will not recognize the fact the it's reinstalled on the same computer.

"I guess this review is kind of late considering April 15 is two days away but better late than never.  This is the 5th or 6th year in a row I have used TaxCut and like the previous years, I am quite pleased.

Since I used it in the prior year, all of the information I entered was carried forward to the current year to use by the software.  That makes it a lot easier.

I don't have a real complicated return.  I do itemize deductions but the most complex thing I deal with are gains and losses on sales of stocks. Even so, I HATE filling out IRS and state tax forms and HATE EVEN MORE the stupid instructions that come with them that only an idiot could have written.  So I am happy to fork over the money for TaxCut and let their much easier question interface lead me through the process, as well as let them determine if I am subject to alternative minimum tax and all these other things thrown in by slimy politicians with ulterior motives.

Several reviewers have complained about the price increase for the 2007 version and I have to agree, I am not happy either.  But considering what you pay to have someone prepare your taxes, it is still pretty reasonable. And I also find it is well worth it to let the program do my taxes instead of pulling out my hair and screaming as I try to make my way through the maze of forms and instructions that comes from the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.

To sum up: I have never had a problem with TaxCut.  The process is very clear, there is a clean data trail that you can print out, and all of the forms print out very cleanly on my printer. I intend to purchase the 2008 program next year unless we have some serious tax reform.. so in other words, I will be buying the 2008 version next year and probably each year's version thereafter.",0

"My 2008 Toshiba war horse came with this software but I waylaid the Vista reinstall CDs to get Works back. (Yes, it did come with the full version of Works, only Office was a trial.) Since I legitimately owned the software, I found a place to re-download it and I sure was glad because other people I support bought computers that originally had Works 9.0 but they lost it when the factory copy of Windows had to be replaced. With them now able to get access to the copy of Works they paid for, it's something that allows them to directly & easily manipulate Works files since they may not want Live Tiles built into their Start menu come Windows 10 and they definitely don't want the gimped Metro interface of 8, being users who value productivity over benchmarking.

"This is such a useful software. I used a freeware FastStone Capture, it does a lot of of image captures, editing and adding annotation text. It can do windows, scrolling windows, shapes, etc. Snagit is a much more advanced image and VIDEO capture app. No wonder I have been hearing about it for years on techpodcasts that I listen to. It can capture actual videos including the movement of your mouse cursor which is very useful if you are creating a tutorial/instructional videos. If you are a gamer, and would like to show your exceptional skill to others, you can actually record part of the game and send it to whoever you want to.

There are multiple ways you can do in capturing contents. The software also give you an option to save as personal profiles for different combination of capturing configuration, so you don't have to repeat those mouse clicks that you use the most. Sort of a mini macro.

On capturing text. It can capture text to editable form even on Windows Explorer, WIndows error pop-ups, and more.

Capturing images also give you a built in editor. If you want to annotate an image that you have captured and you don't have enough space to place your text to, you can easily drag the edge of the image and add extra real state on your canvass for your arrows and annotation. You can enhance images by adding edges, shadows, bevels, etc. You can email an authored image with a click of a button.",0

"I recently loaded Vipre AntiVirus + AntiSpyware on my roughly two year old laptop running Windows XP. Prior to installing Vipre I was using Trend Micro's protection suite. I only made the change to Vipre after my Trend Micro subscription expired.

Installation: Extremely convenient and all told took about 15 minutes including a required reboot. The software is loaded on a single CD/DVD and the software key is included on a separate piece of paper. After rebooting, Vipre prompted me for a required major update which took another 10 minutes or so - no restart required this time.

1st Scan (comprehensive) : After installation the initial scan took approximately 45-50 min for a 250gb HDD. This is roughly the same amount of time that Trend Micro took to complete a comprehensive scan. To my surprise Vipre picked up quite a few vulnerabilities (spyware), cookies and assorted junk that Trend glossed over.

User Interface: Very accessible from the beginning for a new user with zero consultation of the help menu required. In my mind this is where a lot anti-virus s/w suites miss the mark. I'm not a computer security specialist nor do I want to be. Vipre's menu is simple & effective at conveying the right information without an overabundance of terms or buttons. I was setting up scan settings and scans in no time. Also on the vulnerabilities that Vipre did find, it was extremely easy to remove them from my system. Contrast that with Trend Micro which often didn't allow me to quarantine or remove a vulnerability seemingly inexplicably.

System resources: Being that I installed Vipre on a laptop I was mostly keen on keeping my system safe while minimizing any possible slowdowns or performance hiccups caused by s/w. This area is definitely Vipre's strongest. My boot-up times decreased enough for me to notice right away. I don't know an exact time as I never bothered to record my boot-up time whilst using Trend Micro's s/w. But again, a definite and noticeable change for the better.

Based on my positive experiences I would recommend Vipre to anyone as a viable alternative to the well established players.",0

MapPoint is for use by business people who want to research demographics and use other data available for neighborhoods they are interested in. The capability for interface with Excel is provided and seemed to work well.,0
"I have been a fan and user of VideoStudio for a long time (I believe since version 5) and Corel continues to deliver on superb performance for a GREAT price. Yes, I sound like a fan boy, but I'm sorry: for the price, it's a great product.

So what's great about this version? For starters, I used to complain about documentation/tutorial videos, etc. Corel has delivered big-time: look around, Youtube, etc. they've commissioned some great introductory videos, and the documentation is a lot more streamlined. The PDF User Guide is clear, easy-to-read, and the Corel Discovery Center has both video and written tutorials! I have nothing to complain about anymore on this front! This new version also comes in a 64-bit edition, which makes much better use of memory and CPU resources, especially in rendering.

For the absolute newbie, there's a feature called Fast Flick which does quite a reasonable job of creating a movie from assembled clips, which means you can immediately see how things work, enabling a learn-by-watching type experience. The interface layout is self-explanatory, three large sections: Capture/Edit/Share. Since I don't have a need for capture since I don't own anything I can capture from (for example, with certain types of digital cameras, it's possible to capture stop motion movies directly from them, cheap animation! and the Screen Capture looks intriguing), I spend most of my time in the Edit and Share tabs.

Editing is straight-forward. Import your videos, put them onto the tracks, cut out the boring bits, insert other types of media (pictures, sounds) as you wish, ensure you have suitable transitions--so many transitions are available, but please, use sparingly. Titles--again, an immense amount, only a small number of which you'll actually use. And, let's not forget FX. These are advanced  well, effects, you can add to your videos. Essentially, animations, applying color shifts, vintage-looking films, etc. A ton! You get the feeling by now, I hope, that Corel has inundated the budding editor with CHOICE, but just because these exist doesn't mean you have to use them, word to the wise.

My videos got a lot better after reading the superb book, How to Shoot Video that Doesn't Suck. Highly recommended (and I just saw they reduced the Kindle price to $2.51 after I bought it at full price! Argh!)

Exporting (or ""sharing"") your video is also easy, with different output formats available, avi, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, only audio, etc. You can also directly export to YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo. Take my advice, export to a file format THEN upload that file to YouTube, etc. You can also, of course, burn it to DVD.

If you're coming to VideoStudio from another editing suite, I suggest you take the time to learn its idiosyncrasies, of which there are a few (how to manage transitions, for example) but this is the equal of any one of consumer-grade video editing suites. Corel has made some great strides in VideoStudio, and it shows because there's just about nothing I can ding. 5 stars!",0

"Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium version 13 is extremely similar to version 12 but has a lot of added extras, most of those are about the integration with Windows and the social media barrage of utilities.

 On a fresh install, you should be aware that you need.net 4.5 framework for Dragon NaturallySpeaking. After.net InstallShield has finished then the somewhat lengthy process of installing version 13 will occur (in my case, I put it on a laptop with a fairly high chipset, 12 gig of RAM, a secondary SSD drive and a moderately decent motherboard). It still took 90 minutes to complete. Anyway, in the early stages when the license agreement pops up you should read this, since some people may want to return the software.

  You will then be asked for the license key, and my suggestion is for you to choose custom set up. Custom set up gives you multiple options in English, and with most people, if they don't have a lexicon from the US, UK and other places, they will be perpetually corrected by the system. During the lengthy install, and it seems that it is long because the install process works out what the audio has for recording and playback, you will be constantly shown the basic tips and the learning center: from the point of view of someone new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking these two areas plus the quick start guide are the core points for using Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

If you have a version of Dragon, and have spent some time developing your profile, you should have it backed up. If not, you should do it as soon as possible. The handy part is that if you use version 12 and 13 like I do, you can use your profile and have it learning from where you were.
I use Dragon 12 at work and at home, so I have some level of comparison wih the versions in a personal and networked environment. You can't skimp on the system configuration, and if it looks like you might have to, then don't bother using Dragon. Dragon can control some windows functions, but thats not its prime purpose. Where I find it excels is when you have injuries, and I do, Dragon is a great tool. However, keeping your hard drive defragmented and optimized is essential. You can use Norton utils, or if you have issues ( technical issues) get a usb drive  of 8 to 16 gig, and install utils from portable apps dot com; portable apps defrag and optimize tools can basically save your setup, and it helps Dragon function. The biggest contrast I have is that my copy of Dragon at work uses a hard-drive that cannot be defragged because of the network, and the memory is garbage ( 2 gigs for Windows 7 is insane). Dragon is not as bad as some have said in performance, the reason that word shuts down on some computers with Dragon is that the PC has not been defragged and optimized ( by optimized I meand chkdsk with an F switch and other things; in most cases just run the app and click ""opimize"" from portable apps, it does work).

 The quick start guide is basically the main guide that you will initially be referring to, and for the most part it is unchanged from version 12. The elements you need to consider are what headsets you are going to use and in my opinion not use the one that comes with Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I chose KOSS CS-100 because of its noise reduction capabilities; if you don't have a headset with noise reduction capabilities the cyclical feedback will be a constant headache. Also, I would strongly suggest you do not use a broadband Bluetooth headset: this is not just a security suggestion, it is because the amount of people I know who have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and tried the Bluetooth headset, and they just gave up is very high.

This next suggestion is basically more than a suggestion: you will need to keep your hard drive as defragmented as you possibly can, and optimize the functions on Windows as best you can. If you use Dragon NaturallySpeaking on a network device, I know from experience that unless you have a group policy that frees up certain capabilities on your PC, you will have a very hard time using Dragon. The sum total of what happens on a PC is that the profile you use has to be as defragmented as possible, otherwise it will be shutting down about 50 to 60% of the time. The one thing I can say from experience is that when I first got Dragon, I had one arm that I could not use. The big problem is that you will need to use certain keyboard commands, so if you are using or planning to use Dragon with the hope of not doing any keyboard commands at all, then you may need to rethink your plans. You can macro certain things, but until Dragon gets used to your voice, and you get used to Dragon which in my experience can be from four weeks to three months, there is a learning curve.

It is an excellent tool, but the vowel sounds will catch you most of the time and certain conjunct consonants windup delivering some of the most absurd renderings of your speech: but the silly part about it is if you highlight the word or phrase that has come up looking absurd, the version you want is usually in the selection available. In my opinion is a handy tool, but it has its limitations.
  These are the quirks of the system, but once you get to know the short guide, it will allow you to use Dragon easily and quickly. Expect to do some editing; at least part of your verbal commands will be for editing, so you need to know that in advance.

  The claim is one of 99% accuracy but if you expect 93% as your peak, then you won't feel let down when you have to go through and do copious editing. It is very good and Dragon have a tool that is getting better and better since I first saw it around 2000, and the integration with Windows and various applications are getting better and better. Overall if you do want a version of Dragon that operates better, check out the one for Mac, which in my opinion is a lot better, but still this version for PC is still very good.",0

"Pinnacle Studio 19 Plus is  good mid-level video editing software.

This is a solid software choice if you're looking for editing software for personal or family videos, or for basic work/technical film editing.

The learning curve is reasonable and in 1-2 hours, you can do basic editing and video composition. The more sophisticated inputs and channels will take a little longer to learn - but still approachable. The interface of the program isn't too cluttered, and common tools have shortcuts.

YouTube has been invaluable for finding tutorials on how to do different things, and I've relied on it a lot.",0
One of the best free antivirus software.,0
"As a loyal user of Streets and Trips for several years, I have purchased every version (often by pre-order) since 2001.  In short, S&T has several advantages over online alternatives (and a few limitations) that generally make it a worthwhile investment for both business and leisure travelers.

If you already have a previous version of S&T, purchasing this version would primarily be for updated map data and point-of-interest information. The cosmetics are slightly different than S&T 2008, but there are only a few minor feature enhancements. If you are using Google Maps or Mapquest, Streets and Trips offers four distinct advantages over these free alternatives 1) speed 2) control 3) no advertisements 4) offline access (i.e. no Internet required).  Personally, I became a big fan of S&T when I began to travel more frequently prior to having 3G mobile broadband access on my notebook.  The ability to quickly get directions while on a business trip is very, very helpful.

.............. Why Pay For Streets and Trips 2009 When Free Online services Exist?...........

1. The speed of S&T is far superior than Internet-based alternatives. This speed advantage is especially apparent when you pan across sections of a map. In S&T, the response is instantaneous.  Also, showing the point-of-interest locations (subway stops, restaurants, hotels, etc) is lightening fast.  Place the mouse on a particular address or intersecting and select ""Find Nearby Places"". Almost instantaneously, locations in pre-selected categories appear within a defined radius.

2. The ability to tightly control, save and print maps is big plus for power users.  Planning a trip to a new city? You can save as map with directions and locations as a file.  Just double click on the file when you are ready to use - just like any office document.  For those who make road trips, S&T provides the option to apply different speeds to different types of roads (highways, arterial roads, local roads).  Unfortunately, Microsoft stopped allowing input of specific speeds a few revisions ago and now merely has slider bars that range from slowest to fastest.  Also as part of this function, Microsoft allows for input of highway/city vehicle MPG and fuel cost per gallon to calculate the cost of a trip.

3. Advertisements are irritating. Time is money.  The ability to view and print maps without advertisements is a big plus in my opinion.  Why waste your color ink to print a banner ad?  S&T allows to see and print exactly what you want.

4. Don't have mobile broadband on your notebook?  Want to check destination maps while in the air?  Locally stored data is the only solution. Given that the map data is located locally on the user's hard drive, there is no need to get connected to the Internet.  Of course, a hybrid environment that uses both locally stored data and online information is the best of both worlds. S&T is almost there (below).

..............What Has Changed Since Streets and Trips 2008? ..............

In terms of what has changed since S&T 2008, the answer is not much.  If accuracy is important to you, it always makes sense to get the latest map data that represents both new data and corrections of old data.  Point-of-interest data changes much more frequently than street data, so if you a big fan of restaurants this is a valid reason to get the latest version.  However, it is important to understand there still appears to be a significant delay, sometimes over 1-2 years before a new restaurant will be added to the point-of-interest data.  The inability to update this information in real-time is my biggest complaint about Streets and Trips.  While Microsoft is slowly enhancing the live data capabilities, there is still a long way to go.  I would guess the real issue is not technical, but financial. Map and point-of interest data is a multi-billion dollar industry.  It would probably require a subscription on top of the purchase price to provide higher quality point-of-interest data.

The 2009 version appears faster in use but slower to load.  This implies that more data is being loaded into memory upon launch.  This might have something to do with a new process that is continuously running, streetsolkshim.exe for which I have not been able to find any information.  Zooming appears faster than the already extremely fast 2008 version. However, I have no way of confirming this scientifically.

There are some different cosmetics than previous versions.  Most notably are the icons on top menu bar are more descriptive and can be toggled between small and large. They have graphics like a steering wheel button representing the directions function.  My guess is the icon scheme is probably designed for traveling retirees with diminished eyesight.

A minor enhancement is the ability to send an address to a mobile phone from within Streets and Trips. Somewhat oddly, the function does not allow directions to be sent. This may have something to do with SMS message length limitations.

One interesting new function that improves Streets and Trips interactivity with the outside world is the Coupon Function. This connects to Entertainment.com database of coupons. Entertainment Publications, the operator of the Entertainment.com web site, predates the web.  Basically, it is a company that sells coupon books for $35 with deep discounts for restaurants and attractions.  In Streets and Trips 2009, a trial to the service is suppose to be free for two weeks.  Afterwards, you need to purchase a subscription.  Unfortunately, I have not be able to get the service to work after six (6) calls to Microsoft's horrible Indian-based tech support.  The support team members had a poor command of the English language and had zero familiarity with the 2009 version of S&T.  The problem has still not been resolved.

Pros
*Fast
*No advertisements
*Ability to save maps and directions as files for future use
*Locally stored map data
*Some external data connectivity (i.e. coupons, construction, live search)

Cons
*Still no core data updating via the Internet
*Lacks very recent point-of-interest data
*Ridiculously bad tech support

....................Other Notes......................
As much as people tend to dislike Microsoft and complain about software bugs in general, problems with map accuracy are not Microsoft's fault.  They don't create the data. Map data creation is a billion dollar industry run by Navteq (now owned by Nokia) and Tele-Atlas.",0
"PC Mag [...] had rated this very highly which is how I learned of it.  The full article is available at [...].  It is a very good, inexpensive, dependable backup software application.  It has good flexibility and is user friendly (for a backup program).  It allows you to back up an entire hard drive or just selected folders and files.  You can do full or incremental backups and you can schedule them or initiate them manually.  I have mine scheduled for a full backup once a week and a daily incremental backup, all to a removable USB hard drive.  You can tell it to break the back up into 2 GByte slices so you can keep the backup hard drive nicely decluttered by running Windows defrag program from time to time.  We have a Windows XP operating system and it works very well with that.  The program also allows you to create a disaster recovery CD and a corresponding disaster recovery backup on a hard drive.  You can set levels for compression and encryption and set password protection or not.  The more the compression and encryption, the longer the backup takes but the smaller and more secure it is (the default values are fine for me).  You can also adjust the intensity of the backup effort so it will run more slowly in the background so it won't interfere with you while you are using the computer or more quickly if you schedule the backups to be done at night (as I do).  The manufacturer was very responsive when I had some initial questions about it.  Unlike Norton Ghost, which we also have, it will not communicate on-line when you tell it not to.

To add to my initial review one year later (January 2010): in a year of ownership I have greatly benefited by learning to depend on the program's termination features. You can have it just run the backup on schedule and stop, or after the backup you can also set it to automatically perform ""power"" functions. These include shutdown, log off, Standby, and Hibernate (assuming you have configured your computer for Hibernate). What this means is that my copy of this program at work starts a backup a little after my normal office hours and shuts the computer down afterwards. So I get an incremental backup of the day's complete work without spending productive office time doing it and save energy by turning it off, too. At home I have it tuck itself into Standby after our normal bed time. So we get full use of the computer all day, a backup of the day's activities afterwards, and don't let it run up our utility bill, either. And Standby turns off the USB backup drive as well to preserve its longevity.  On the other end of the spectrum you can set it to wake up your computer from Standby to run a backup before you need to use the computer.  The settings also show up in the Scheduled Tasks for Windows XP and Windows Vista (unlike any of the Ghost products). We now have four licensed copies of Genie. It is easily a better backup tool than the others we have tried: Norton Ghost 10.0, Norton Ghost 14.0, Norton 360, DT Utilities' PC Backup Pro, or the native Windows XP and Windows Vista backup programs. Genie does what you tell it to, unlike Norton Ghost which has a fit because it missed one day's scheduled incremental backup or Windows Vista's native backup which will only restore the computer to the way it was when the backup was made and therefore requires the same size hard drives partitioned into volumes exactly the same way (sort of a joke because by the time a good hard drive wears out you find they do not make them that small anymore so you can not replace it with an identical hard drive!).",0
"I really like Webroot.  It does an excellent job protecting against attacks, does not impede the PC performance and will run a scan faster than anything else I have tried.  It will find some residual issues on the first run and after this it does a fantastic job protecting the PC.  I have it installed on my home desktop, laptop as well as the PC's for my wife and two son's.  That's a lot of web time and we have never had any issues with our PC's.  It proactively protects against threats and if anything should land on your PC, it will be pretty benign and the scan will pick it up quickly, clean it completely and do it all it the background.

"I have been using SM for nearly 5 years now. I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

Highly recommended!",0
"I've read the other reviews of this product here, and there are clearly a lot of negatives. Some people find this program too big, some find it too small.
I found it just right.
When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.
Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software.
You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.
I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring.
Now, I have no employees, and I have no interest in eBay, so I sympathize with those who felt that there were more parts to this than they needed. However, I found that this package has just the amount of power I need for keeping track of hours, jobs, clients, income, and expenditure. If I have employees some day, I won't have to learn new software. I can foresee needing to use the banking features, so I'm glad they're there. The extra features don't hamper my use of what I currently need, and I've had the experience before of spending more on trading up than I would have if I'd bought something more powerful to begin with.
I would strongly recommend this package for small businesses.",0
"I love the new interface, and thought I'd miss the start button,so I downloaded the start shell execution file.  After playing with 8 for a couple of hours, I never put the start button back. I have upgraded my 3 computers, my daughter's, and several of my friends.  They all love the program.

Update: 3/1/13 I love this program and I will never go back to Windows 7. The interface is so easy to use, and I have probably upgraded over 100 computers now with it, and so far have not had one complaint. It plays all my games and all of my other software has had zero problems.

Update: September 25, 2013

I seriously think this is Microsoft's best operating system ever. I still has some minor flaws, but it is very fast, and finds the right drivers. I recently added a parallel port by PCI Express. I restarted, entered the bios, saved changes, and booted into Windows 8. Then I went into the device manager, parallel port, properties, and changed the port settings from LPT-3 to LPT-1 where it is supposed to be. I turned on my old HP Laserjet 5, and plugged in the cable while Windows 8 was running. Down on the taskbar, Windows was loading the right drivers for that 20 + year old printer. Take the time to learn 8, and it will out perform 7, 3 to 1. It even downloads my I Phone, and 7 would not.",0

It scans my computer automatically and tunes it up. Periodically, I run the scan and fixes manually. I believe it keeps my older computer running better than it did without this fine program. Great Program and the price is right!",0

"I choose the online download to monitor the process.  I did a downoad and expect this to work with improving my computer.  After the installation, I downloated the Norton Eraser which locates bad files, etc. reveals the status and next I did a Remove or Repair.  What occurs is removing items that are at risk, then, it will do a remove or repair.  What the Create System Restore Point does is remove the risks.

Next, I downloaded the Boot Recovery.  Not sure when this is beneficial, but to be safe, I downloaded it in case I have trouble. The instructions and prompts provide easy maneuvering.  That is a critical role as maneuvering is critical for success.  Set up was good, quick, easy.

This promises to do a lot to protect my computer.  Time will tell and I have not had enough indication to determine whether it has made a great improvement.  Mostly, we all want security and protection for out computers.

Will update as I determine the condition and performance of this Norton Antivirus addition.  Rizzo",0

"I've long promoted AVG's free products to friends who asked my opinions. I've tried them myself, and they provide an acceptable level of service- great news, considering the price. However, after a terrible experience with a well-known security product several years ago (see my other reviews for details), I swore off all security programs, deciding instead to be vigilant with my machines and my internet activities as a better way to protect my machines. Recently, though, I've tried several new products, and haven't had any major issues with any of them (though there have been some minor frustrations- see below). AVG Internet Security 2011 is the best I've seen, though, by far.

After test-driving Norton 360 on my 'junk' machine, and being frustrated with the way it tends to make decisions FOR the user, instead of giving the user options on how to handle potential threats, I was hoping to find a product that would be equally vigilant in detecting potential issues without taking the machine over. AVG Internet Security 2011 does just that. As you may know, some programs register 'false-positives' with security software- they are safe programs, but they exhibit some characteristics that trigger suspicion. That's fine- if my security software thinks there may be a threat, I want to know about it. However, some security software (like Norton) take the initiative of deleting or quarantining automatically, and this can be very frustrating. AVG engages the user at every juncture, presenting options to clean, delete, or make exemptions for such software. This is very helpful.

More generally, AVG runs silently, it doesn't use up a lot of resources, and its notification system is great- notices are displayed as corner pop-ups that don't distract, but are easy to review if desired. I never really had any issues before I got AVG, and haven't had any since, but it's great to know I'm protected without having to sacrifice performance or worry about the program doing something I don't want it to without my knowledge.

In brief, AVG Internet Security 2011 is a sound investment, and the fact that customer service is available makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the free versions. Highly recommended for anyone looking for effective, non-intrusive security for their PC.",0

"This is a pretty good piece of software if you're a small company, looking to save some money on legal documents.  Lawyers can cost an arm and a leg (and part of the other arm too) where I live, so this kind of software is a good thing to have.  I wouldn't use this if I were a huge corporation with 1,000 employees, though.

But if you're small, and need some help with things like this, then it's probably right up your alley.  On top of the documents you can prepare, there's also five legal books on the CD as well.  I won't list them all, you can just look at the main product listing for that.

It also has another side benefit - it's not JUST for businesses.  Your home can get some benefit from this as well.

It is easier to learn and operate and does an enormous range of image editing tasks.  I've produced excellent original art work on it.  I also have edited or manipulated images with ease.  It comes in at 1/6th the cost of Photoshop and for a vast pool of users out there, it more than does the job.

"Ive always enjoyed stop-motion/claymation movies. My only previous experience in making such a film comes from an interactive museum exhibit over a decade ago. Although that previous experience was brief, it was far more time consuming and complicated than this software. Honestech makes it easy to make stop motions movies!

To adequately judge how intuitive a software is to use, I like to see what I can determine without looking at the manual. I was able to figure out all of the software features covered in the quick start guide. That being said, its not intended to be used by professional movie makers because it does lack the 1001+ menu controls that professionals want, but never use. If you're like me and you just want to make some quick movies for fun, then this is all you need.

Camera Setup: My webcam was already installed so the software recognized it immediately. You can also use a DSLR camera if you want good image quality (I didn't test that ability).
Frame Capture: Capturing a frame is as easy as pressing the spacebar, or clicking a red button. To make positioning of the next frame easier, you can use whats called Onionskin.
Onionskin: Onionskin superimposes the previous frame on top of your current camera view so that you can position your frame perfectly  you can control the level of transparency.
Rotoscope: Similar to Onionskin, you can open up a previously saved image to superimpose to aide in recreating a previous scene. Again, the transparency is in your control.
Chroma Key: This is the green-screen effect, only for the color of your choice. You can replace the background of your movie with an image of your choice.
Audio: You can record audio or add background music.
Others: You can add still-frame photographs or images, title scene or ending credit scene, and you can also adjust contrast or apply image filters (like black & white).
Output: You can upload files directly to facebook or YouTube in addition to the usual save as movie options.",0
"I am a big fan of Turbotax, and have been for many years.  I find their products very ""intuitive"" to use, and the question-and-response method of entering tax data is very useful to me.  What's more, I like the fact that they offer different versions of the software for different tax situations.  I have used many versions, but this year again, the Premier edition is perfect for my situation, with some stock action to report, as well as rental income.  (P.S.  Their small business and self-employed version is great, too, and helped my self-employed wife for many years accurately report income, in order to get social security credit, and properly file.)

Lots of people complain about TurboTax each year, but I think you will see, the overwhelming amount of reviews are positive.

For over 10 years now, TurboTax has helped us quickly, accurately, and easily file our taxes.  Simply go through each section (income, deductions, credits, etc.), answering each question as it pertains to you.  Voila!  Any credits you are due are credited, any deductions, too.  It will tell you if you're better off taking the standard deduction, or itemizing.

Filing is a piece of cake.  It lets you electronically transmit your data to the IRS, and saves a .pdf file of your return for you, every single form needed.  Refunds are processed quickly, within a week to 10 days has been my experience.

I highly recommend this product if you have investment income/losses to report, as well as rental property.  If not, simply go to their website, or look on amazon, and find the version that is right for you.  They offer 4 different versions to cover individual situations.",0
"Others have covered most of what I want to say, but I thought I'd add a few comments.

First, VMware really rocks on my 8-core Mac Pro. For some reason I don't quite understand, it runs some Windows benchmarks within a virtual machine *faster* than booting Windows natively on the box! Graphics-intensive apps seem to do better natively, but anything that does lots of I/O seems to run faster under VMware.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that it's really more than just Windows on a Mac - you can run just about any Intel operating system within VMware. On my Mac Pro, I have Linux (both RedHat and SuSE/Novell) and a few other old Intel-based operating systems - even a very old OS/2. Honestly, this helped me justify the price of my Mac Pro - one box runs Mac, several versions of Windows, Linux and so on. And they all run really well... :)

"I bought two copies of the Win8 Pro upgrade, one for myself and one for my elderly mother.

"This program is an absolute blast to use!  Think of creating your own Wallace and Gromit style movies.  Of course, it is tedious, and time consuming (you'll be amazed at how short your film ends up being after quite a bit of work), but it can be fun as well.  The software is really easy to use, and it helps you along.  For example, you can overlay the previous frame on your current one to make sure you didn't move the LEGOs (or whatever your subject is) too far at one time.  The final product is surprisingly professional.

The only thing you need to be aware of is that this doesn't work with just any camera.  You need certain camcorders or DSLR cameras (listed in the product description) or you can simply use the computer's web cam.  Of course, that means two major drawbacks.  First, your built in webcam probably doesn't offer you very many options in aiming the camera.  Second, most built in webcams are very low resolution.  So while you can shoot HD video with this, you can't with your built in webcam.  The end result is slick, but too low resolution for most needs.

In the end, this is five star software if you have the right camera, but four star software if you don't.",0

"If you've ever wished you could create beautiful HDR images, this software can make your dreams come true, as it did for me.  I learned about Photomatix Pro from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Improve-Your-HDR-Photography-Improve-Your-Photography/dp/B0048EKIR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Improve Your HDR Photography (Improve Your Photography)</a>by Jim Harmer.  The program is also available on-line at hdrsoft dot com, where you can get a free trial before buying.

This program is extremely easy to use, and once you've taken your three shots with auto-exposure bracketing, or more exposures at your choosing, you just click to upload them, and then follow the on screen choices.  A tripod is certainly necessary for good clean HDR images, but this software is so flexible that it will take your hand-held (slightly off) images, and align them, also fixing any ""ghosting"" from moving trees or shaky images. You can also use single images and apply tone-mapping, which also gives dynamic images.  Simple sliders allow you to tweak your images before saving them.

Your first tries will no doubt prove to be eye-openers, but keep in mind that the best images are the ones that are not ""overdone"" and totally fake looking.  Professionals use this program, and given its simplicity and affordability, so can you.

"While Microsoft Office will likely always be the most popular office software suite, Corel's WordPerfect Office X7 is a comprehensive office suite that does everything Microsoft Office does, and more. And with the improvements of this latest version of WordPerfect, Corel has, in my opinion, presented several compelling reasons to consider switching from Microsoft Office to WordPerfect Office X7.

In this version of WordPerfect, the two main things Corel has done is update the user interface, and address Microsoft Office file compatibility issues. Microsoft file compatibility was a huge issue if you wanted to use previous versions of WordPerfect, and, in fact, its previous inability to work with Microsoft files was a deal-breaker for me. However, you can now easily work with all Microsoft Office files. And now where WordPerfect even betters Microsoft Office is in its ability to create and edit pdf files. For me, this is a HUGE plus, and this ability alone is a good reason for you to consider using or switching to WordPerfect. However, another very big advantage to this WordPerfect version is it also includes an eBook publisher and CD/DVD burning software. Nice!

If you're not required to use Microsoft Office for work, I would definitely recommend using this WordPerfect suite instead. It does everything that Microsoft Office can do and significantly more. And at a better price! I really like this latest version of WordPerfect. It really is a terrific suite. I recommend it very highly and I'm quite certain that you'll like it, too.

If you have any questions about this software, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my very best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.",0

One again Quicken has improved a product that seemingly needed no improvement.  The tabs are better and downloading of data is MUCH faster than previous versions.  As a Beta Tester I would highly recomend this program.,0

"I've always been a fan of McAfee's Total Protection, so I was a bit skeptical about Webroot.

But, after installing it on my laptop, my fears have been alleviated.  The total install size was much smaller than what I'm used to, but all the functionality is there.  Better still, the default security settings on Webroot didn't make my machine unusable:  no overly restrictive firewall rules, no quarantining half of my programs, no blocking web access to my favorite games.

Installation was clean and simple.  The initial scan took a long time, but completed with no issues and no false alarms.positives as of yet, and no blocked apps.  I don't download freeware/shareware off of the internet, so I guess the woes of my fellow reviewers don't apply to me at all.

Solid product. Easy to use.",0
"I was curious about this product, since I am a faithful user of the McAfee SiteAdvisor Firefox addon, which is free.

This product installed immediately, and I couldn't find anything new that it offered me. This program acts as a surreptitious bar down on your internet browser toolbar that uses a color coded system of letting you know when you are browsing user reported safe sites or bad ones. I find this product EXTREMELY useful for all users, advanced or novice, because you never know when you do happen to stumble on a website that is loaded with viruses and spyware. This program acts as an alert to tell you which one you are in fact visting.

It doesn't take up any CPU, that I can tell, and it does have a community feature that allows you to view what others have written about the site and why they thought it was good or bad. I think maybe I would just stick with the free add on that is offered on the web versus paying for this, because I did not see anything that was new with the ""Plus"" program.

Regardless, I recommend everyone to have this SiteAdvisor on every computer you own, this is coming from someone who has had to format countless times because of virus and spyware absconding into depths that my virus/spyware programs couldn't find.

Great Product.",0
"I am a 20 year user of Quicken.  Generally I have been satisfied with it until this year.  I am a Mac owner and have installed Parallels and Windows just so I could run Quicken.

I even was a beta tester for their Mac product.  I was disturbed when as a tester that Quicken ignored the majority of the other beta testers who were asking them to basically port the Windows version and features to the Mac version.

Now with 2013 they have decided to eliminate a simple way they had been using to enter, track and pay loans.  Instead they have created an obscure, complicated, not user friendly process (Not a simple window with your needed options like ""pay"" and ""when"" and ""make extra payment"" and check balances.)

Other users have complained about this and several have said they will drop the program after many years if Quicken does not change it to the simple process it was before.

I will wait a month and if it is not fixed, I will look for a better finance program.",1
"As expected.

"I choose this rating because I know this product and the Company behind it's development.  I have been using this production (Trend Micro) for over ten years and I find it most capable of doing a most effective job of maintaining my systems while on the internet. I recommend this product to all of my family and in fact, I kept their subscriptions active each year when the old one expires.",0
"Couple of key things when looking at software. First, how does it run. The best features or potential in the world are useless if the program is buggy or frustrating.  Corel runs great.  It loads quick, a fair bit quicker than Adobe Illustrator (and other Adobe programs), and runs fine on even older computers.  It's a cleaner program, it seems.  Yet, it's also feature rich.  While AI and the Adobe suite are considered industry standard, that is increasingly more tradition and habit than a reflection of capability.  I'd go as far to say that for Windows users Corel is a step ahead of Adobe, both because it connects fluidly with Visual Studio for application development and OneDrive for cloud storage, and because it offers a purchasable product rather than a rental. Adobe, after all, has moved fully into the subscription mode, so that you have access as long as you pay a fee. Sure you get upgrades but you also pour constant money into Adobe's coffers, with nothing of your own.

CorelDRAW comes in a box, with a disc.  You buy it, it's yours.  You can work online if you want, or offline as long as you want.  It's not constantly nagging you for upgrades. It's a well-designed software package that is primarily about design, with accompanying support programs, like photo-paint, which make for a unified suite that will serve almost any purpose. If you're new to design software, I'd heartily recommend Corel because of this, unless of course you're in a company or profession that demands you toe the Adobe line.  Not to say Adobe is bad, it's great, but it's strengths no longer, in my opinion, outweigh its frustrations and liabilities.  Indeed, I have a 1 year subscription with the Adobe suite already (primarily for its web design capabilities, which Corel doesn't come close to matching)

CorelDRAW is setup for the new user, facilitating pros but giving a lot of guidance and tutorials for those new to the program.  If you're not already comfortable with AI or another program, are looking for a job in the design industry, and want to have a program that you own, that's yours, that has high quality features and capabilities while running smoothly, then Corel is the way to go.",0
"I have been using an older version of Microsoft Word (the whole Microsoft Office suite) on my main laptop. I can't re-download it for some reason to my backup laptop (it won't let me even though I still have my registration code) that I keep at my parent's house so I decided to get one of the Open Source suites. I tried Apache first and it wasn't that good. Lots of issues with the word processing - the main program I use - so I uninstalled Apache and downloaded this suite - LibreOffice v4.3 for PC.

AMAZING! Works just like Word in every way and you can open Libre documents in Word and vice versa. The suite is also compatible with Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. I was surprised to learn that a lot of companies use and support Libre Open Office suite as their regular suite. Think about how cost effective this is for everyone. I guess I won't be buying Microsoft Office again. Ever.

With the word processing program, I can create documents for reviews and then paste them right into the review form on Amazon with no problem. I can also transfer text into word documents easily. It's perfect. Publisher is also pretty amazing too.

Highly recommend.",0
"I received this copy of Quicken 2007 for Mac preloaded on my Intel iMac. I love it. It works flawlessly (knock on wood). I've never had it crash or lock up on me once! It backs up to my .Mac account and prints reports, budgets, lists, accounts, anything. I like the way it autofills lines and automatically adds the decimal points. I've been using Quickbooks Pro 2007 for Mac for my business. I wish it was nearly as good as this Quicken. It stinks. I think it should get 2 stars only. I'm really suprised to see all the complaints and bad reviews. I think it is a highly polished piece of software. It makes me wonder if the preloaded software is somehow better? I don't know.",0
"For the first time in many years I have been pleased with a Microsoft Windows family OS.  When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.
Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.
This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.
The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)
I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.
As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.
I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:
* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever
* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start
* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP
* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically
* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP
* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.
* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.
And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.
In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.
I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.

"I have used TurboTax for years, so it is the path of least resistance for me.  It seems to do a good job, and it helps get the job done quickly and with minimal agony.",0
"Back about a million years ago, when I operated businesses with around 50 employees and hundreds of products. I would have drooled over a product as capable as QuickBooks at this low a price. I bought an IBM System 36 for more than a hundred thousand 1980s dollars and spent tens of thousands more on accounting software that didn't hold a candle to QuickBooks Premier. Heck, my super-expensive software wouldn't even do payroll: had to use an outside service for that.

 Today I operate as a one-man consultancy. I have no products to inventory, no employees to account for: I have none of the problems and challenges QuickBooks was made to address.

 Frankly, I'm sorry that I don't. I'm a data junky and I love all the reports QuickBooks can produce. But for my little business, the simple Schedule C produced by Intuit's junior product, Quicken Home & Business does just fine.

 Because my work as a forensics expert requires that I know about many, many aspects of technology, I do a lot of product testing, including in this instance, QuickBooks. Installation  is straight-forward. But the learning curve is steep. Fortunately there are many books, videos, trainers, articles and consultants to help you find your way.

 Overall, QuickBooks has developed a massive franchise because it works. It may not be without problems, but it works and is a far better value than the software that coast me tens of thousands of dollars to do less years back.

"I have been a loyal TurboTax user since 2003.  It is easy, as thorough as you need it to be for at home use, and affordable compared to professional tax return services.  I have never had a problem installing this software for 8 years now, and it has always performed reliably, preparing flawless tax returns, and ensuring quick and easy refunds.

I've used the relevant versions to report Schedule C self-employment income (the program quickly and easily calculates the self-employment tax, ensures you get social security credit for your self employment, and gives you next year's estimated tax payments) as well as investment income.  The feature to download 1099-DIV and 1099-INT statements from your investments accounts is priceless, as is its ability to calculate your short and long-term capital gains.  Schedule D is a scary form, I cannot imagine doing it myself.  Yet I breeze through it year after year with the help of TurboTax and the automatic imports from my brokerage accounts.

If you're thinking of giving this program a try, I can thoroughly recommend it.  Your life is about to become a lot easier ... enjoy your refund!!",0
"I have been using Tutbotax for years.  Now I have begun ordering the online, downloadable version which enables me to get a copy the same day as I order and it works great.

The charitable deductions definition is useful too.",0

We've done throughput tests and they're pretty much up there at maximum. We have 3 lines in Cat-5e and the rest are Cat-6. The runs are between 3m/12ft and 25m 85ft.

Everything works which is actually true for any Windows OS unlike Mac OSX which claims the same but means only apple software from apple will work.  Anyhow it's a major step up from Windows ME, rarly craches or has any issues what so ever, all my programs and games work as they always have.  Very happy and this OS is just as good in 2012 as it was on release day.  Very happy.",0

"I was skeptical that an entry-level product would really allow me to create animations, but Anime Studio delivers the goods. It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

OK, now for my input device recommendation: Anime Studio has good drawing tools. Lots of animation work requires precise placement of points, drawing of paths, etc. You really want to use a tablet. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WACOM-CTE450K-Black-Bamboo-Fun-Tablet-with-Pen-Mouse-Graphics-Software-NEW/dp/B002QJASB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WACOM CTE450K Black Bamboo Fun Tablet with Pen, Mouse & Graphics Software (NEW)</a>&nbsp;is a perfect match for Anime Studio.

Highly recommended, especially given the low price.",0
"I love using Dragon Dictate for both work and personal tasks! It's such a joy when Dragon ""gets"" who I am, and how I speak, turning my words into carefully written notes that flow well and require minimal correction.

"What else is there to say? Trend Micro continues to make me happy as my antivirus of choice. It does just what I need, and doesn't force itself on me if I don't want it. It doesn't invade my system like other AVs out there, and it works perfectly without being bloated and huge.

If you're looking for a low-cost, high-end antivirus you can't go wrong with Trend Micro.",0

"Been using H&R Block tax software (Tax Cut) for more years than I can remember.
Used Turbo Tax before that for several years. Finally tried Tax Cut, now H&R Block because my Dad was using it and  the lower cost than Turbo Tax.
It has handled everything for me over the years from K 1 forms to investment forms including cap gains/losses etc.
It has even handled for me with out a hitch a necessitated amended return.
As my forms have gotten more complex over the years I have never had an issue.

Now that being said I have one recommendation:
Even though at this point in time I am very familiar with how this tax program flows I do carefully read each step in the interview and answer each question carefully. This little detail will insure you get the forms and pages you need. If you do miss something you will not get the page you need. You will have to go back and hunt it down. You are better off saying yes to a question you are not sure of. You can always skip the part when you get to it.
This year I may actually use the download function for some financial firms like Fidelity to save me manually keying in all the data. Much easier to verify and be done with it.
Actually this program makes it a joy to do your taxes, if I can say that.
The State part is just as easy because of the carry over from the Federal part.
Push of a button and its e-filed. Love it.",0
"We do allot of advertising and surfing to promote some of the new features of our websites from time to time.

"As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios.",0

I still open office docs sent to me in Office, but otherwise I create docs on Pages. If your an Apple fan you can't go wrong here.

"The name 'Norton Anti-Virus' doesn't have the same universal brand-name cachet it once did (think Kleenex or Q-Tips), but this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Antivirus-2011-1-User-Old-Version/dp/B0040GCIBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Antivirus 2011 - 1 User [Old Version</a>] is definitely easy to install, easy to use, and I must admit to a kind of sense of being well-protected when using it.

Hard to really 'test' this product without running head-first into malware ... and I'd rather not go that far.  I'll just appreciate the ease of usage and trust the reputation.",0
"Right off, prepare to be irritated by the registration process for PagePlus: if you don't register the program by calling a *telephone number!!*, you will be pestered every time you start PagePlus. If you do register, be prepared to spend about 9 minutes speaking to customer service. This is rather incredible that in 2011 you still have to do this.

Apart from this rather annoying start, I have to say that PagePlus is a great piece of software. And complex. Luckily, the opening splash screen offers some help in the form of online video tutorials and also a 256-page User Guide. The quality of these guides are actually clear and pleasing to view, quite educational. The included Quick Start Guide gets you on your way if you're not a manuals reader like me. There is a LOT of very useful information here, if you have the time to go through them.

I was able to very quickly open one of numerous design templates and create a newsletter. The design templates come in a variety of colors and themes so for the newbie, it's incredibly useful--you can quickly create anything from calendars to scrapbooks, business cards, all sorts of fliers and posters.

The newsletter template I was using had two inserts for graphics which when clicked on opened an Import Picture window with a choice to either link or embed the picture. The process could not be easier! The layout is well-thought-out: to the right are the panes for choosing colors, lines, transparencies and schemes in addition to those for creating new pages, picking swatches (in RGB or CMYK format) and even a gallery from which you can choose cartoon icons/symbols and other graphics. The bottom bar holds a storage place for graphics and other media that may end up in your work.

The great thing is the end product which is available as an industry-standard PDF for publishing  or as a graphic. It is also possible to send the project file directly as an email attachment. In addition to all this, the features and tools available are staggering, from a ""LogoStudio"" for designing logos, to a built-in PhotoLab photo editor and even an Image Cutout Studio that enables the user to edit out or in backgrounds and other graphics. Truly outstanding.
I have to confess that I didn't think too highly of this product when I started because of the hassles I had with registration, but with each use, I see even more reason to like PagePlus. I am truly blown away by the feature-set available and all the tools available for creating the numerous types of publications you want.

5 well-deserved stars.",0
Did my taxes and other then they customer service needs work. it was slightly better then last year and the State taxes papers were Really Really slow but otherwise good,0
"I have used Turbo Tax for the last four years and have had no problems. I do not like the fact that they charge an extra $19.99 to E-file your state tax form, they should be more up front and include it in the price. This year they offered 10% more on your tax return if you bought Amazon gift cards. I did this and it worked out great! It was like getting Turbo tax and all sales taxes on all my purchases from Amazon for free!",0
I own a small business and always trying to decrease time spent with productivity. With thus software I do just that. It is easy to use and understand. Great software!,0
"Windows Xp is by far the best operating system to ever come out of Microsoft.
- Increased speed, You will notice a 10-15 percent increase in speed when starting applications, doing simple tasks like cutting and pasting large files, Boot time has at least cut in half from previous windows os
- Increaed security, If you are a 95, 98, or ME user you are using the fat32 file system. NTFS is a much more advantaced and secure file system
- Increased Stability, Tried of the dreded blue screen? No more with xp. I have tried to crash my xp system and it just doesn't happen. No more hitting the switch because your system freezes, and no more scandisk (which is a tribute to the better ntfs file system)
- Multiple Users, Windows Xp makes it unbeliveibly easy to manage differnet users. You can set up as many different users as you want with almost no effort. It also has the ability to ""fast switch"" users so you can logoff and someone else can log on, but when you come back anything you were working on, or windows that you had open are still there!
Also the added security makes your files invisible to other users but it allows you to share your files with other, like pictures or music very easily
- Hardware Support, I was surprised to see someone complaining about xp not surrporting their hardware, This operating system supports the most amount of hardware from printers to network cards than any other operating system i have ever seen. And i have used amost all different types of operating systems that you can think of from linux to bsd.
- The help and support feature is a huge upgrade from any previous os. It is extremely easy to use and includes some of the most common problems or tasks right there for you to use. It can also go onlin on the microsoft site and grab possible answers to your question from there making it almost impossible to not find the answer to your problems. Xp also has a built in remote desktop feature so that you can invite a computer geek friend to connect to your computer and control remotely to help you with your problem. (you can also connect to microsofts help and support and allow them to remotely troubleshoot your system)
- Digital Hub, Windows xp is much more robust when it comes to digital photos and music allowing you to view your photots in different ways and even order prints right from your pictures folder!
As a previous Windows ME user i was pretty mad at Microsoft for releasing such a bad operating system, but they redemed themselves with the release of XP. If you are thinking of upgrading than do it. You will be happy.",0
"I have used Quicken since Microsoft abandoned MSMoney, On a Windows PC. Sick of the PC crashing, freezing, fluttering and otherwise giving me the finger, I bought a MAC. No freezing, crashing or security issues ! Even runs most PC software ! But not Quicken. Just something called Quicken Essentials, made for people who don't bank on-line, don't invest, don't have options or IRAs or 401k accounts. In other words, made for the folk who buy ""Lotus 1-2-3 for Dummies"".

So, I make do with a PC Laptop for accounting, using the LAN of my MAC to download, and have on it Turbotax as well, all the while cursing the Intuit penchant for outdated technology.",1
"This router works like a charm and I cannot get my hands off this one. I needed a router to practice for my CCNA and CCNP and decided to look online for a place to get a good router; Amazon was great and this store was awesome.

"I got the basic program set at a very good price.  When I loaded it over my Office 2003 it spared my Publisher.  MSO Basic 2007 does not include Publisher.

I wish I could use it to update my other computers, but that is not an option.  This set is for only one user - actually only one computer.

I find all the new innovations mind boggling.  Yet, the wisdom of most of the changes are apparent, and their are clearly additions that do not exist on earlier releases.

I am aware of other program suites that will satisfy most business users.  One is a free or open source office suite.  I'm just saying that Microsoft Office 2007 Basic is a really great suite of programs.  You must decide for yourselves what you want to spend and what will meet your needs.",0
"easy to use/install - amazon library helpful.

"I just finished my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems. Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word ""camel"" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permit Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...), copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

pluged into my second pc ( other office ) presto internet. easy simple i love easy and simple. would recomend it to a freind,0
"I've been working with OS X for several months now. MY resistance to upgrading to Jaguar (OS X.2) was based primarily on the fact that I bought a new iMac last year and didn't want to shell out more money for the new OS. Finally, I gave in. And it was worth the time and effort.
Jaguar has a cleaner, faster interface to work in. Start-up is much faster. It's a more stable system than OS X (which is saying something, because OS X was already the most stable Mac OS).
The Mail client is also improved immensely over the previous version.
Jaguar includes iChat (instant messaging software), Mail, Address Book, and downloads are available for iSync (basically allows you to port your info from home to work and back seamlessly), iCal (scheduling software), and the new Safari web browser. (A warning though, at this writing Safari is still in Beta testing and definitely needs refining before going live.)
Put this together with the iLife software package (iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD), and you've got yourself one great computer system.
As usual, Apple is letting third parties write their manuals. You'll have to buy those separately if you want them. However, this time they've included an interactive ""Getting Started"" CD which will get the novice up and running in Jaguar without too much stress.",0
USB hubs are mostly all the same and serve the same function. This stands out because of its clever and cute design. It folds together nicely for traveling and the ports are situated a good distance apart.,0
"I've been using PaintShop Pro for many years now and have been very satisfied with its features and ease of use. It's affordable while offering similar features to other more expensive photo editing software such as Photoshop. This latest version includes the FaceFilter 3 tool which allows you to correct/enhance areas which involves skin tones. The software is easy to use as always while allowing professional level photo editing results. I mainly use the ""Unsharp Mask"" function which actually sharpens images nicely while offering fine tuning of the level of sharpness applied. Not only can you edit photos but you can also paint and draw with this software. There're a bunch of brushes of different sizes and shapes and there's also the text input function for adding text into your images. It's a very well rounded image editing package.",0

"I have used quicken for many years to track income and expenses.

unlike its bigger brother, quick books, this is ideal for home use (unless you NEED a 16 column ledger?)

since most of the bills are paid electronically, this is perfect, as you can download from the bank or credit union, and upload into quicken.

"I wrote in my review of Norton Internet Security 2008 that I used the product - but despised it.  The hit to my system's resources was just too great, and I turned much of it off as a result.

The 2009 version is MUCH faster - to the point where I am leaving all options enabled.  The hit to the system appears to be minimal.  The user interface is simpler and less confusing also.  Big improvements all around.

Be aware that the engines underlying Internet Security 2009 and Norton 360 are reported to be different, with 360 using the older version (i.e., performance problems).",0
"It covers screen barely on sides. Falls bit short on top n bottom too. It may look like large size guy wearing medium size pants. Display is amazingly sharp, stunning and beautiful. It catches No fingerprints. It doesn't create a glare either. Works perfectly in outdoor too. Giving 5 stars only due to size issue. I wish it would be bit larger on all edges. I haven't dropped my phone since applying this screen protector so can't speak for that part. Will see how it goes.",0

Nice product.,0
"The product installed easily and seems to work very well  on a Win 8.1 64 bit system.  I installed the R3 update prior to testing. The software learning curve seems very easy.  Unlike previous versions the product did not display any errors or did I have any other kinds of problems getting it set up and working.  The interface has been streamlined somewhat and it should make it easier for beginning users to get up and running with the program.  My only real complaint is that Intuit. for both Quicken and Quickbooks, only seems to support these versions for three years or so and then you have to upgrade.  They also no longer offer upgrade pricing on their products.  That is highly unsatisfactory.

Overall this is a excellent product and is recommended.",0
"Let's take a closer look at this version..

My favorite new features in QuickBooks 2010:

- The ability to paste customer/vendor/item data from Excel spreadsheets
- The new favorites menu so that you can quickly access deep menu items with fewer clicks
- The ability to search for reports in the Report Center, easily find the report you want
- Improved online banking integration

Should you upgrade from QB 2009 to 2010? Personally I'd decide based on whether those four new features are important to you.

The downside is that a lot of the nice add-ons cost extra to activate, as others have pointed out.",0
"This is a very good product.  I like to easy to use format of Word and Power Point.  I have not used the Note or Excel.

"I bought this video splitter for a work tradeshow - it was excellent! Plug in all your sources, push the power button to ON, and you're done. If only the rest of the electronics were that easy...",0
"I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 7. When Corel first bought it from it's shareware creators, they began to dumb it down and it really lost a great deal of its following. Fortunately, they left most of the power under the hood and those features that had been dumbed out of the menus, were still accessible for power users.

I've since upgraded to PSPX and PSP 14, so I am very familiar with the program. Lets start with the inevitable comparison to photoshop. Paint Shop Pro can do,  and has been able to do, 95%+ of what Photoshop as been able to do all along... Layers, yep had them forever, curves, yep... Color enhancement, easy one fixes and removing objects, they are all there. White balance correction, yep - in several places actually. It can read raw files from most major camera makers and will save to any format you can imagine. It can remove objects, repair old photos, make new photos look old, add frames, upload to Flickr, facebook, photobucket, etc... It really does it al.

Paint Shop Pro is powerful enough for anyone, even the snide, presumptuous photo editors that would have you believe that if your photo editing package didn't cost $500 then it isn't worth looking at... Pure elitist hogwash.

ANYTHING that you want to do with a photo can be done with this program.

So why isn't it more widely accepted?

Well, the industry likes a standard and photoshop was the standard back when PSP was still a $79 shareware program. So Photoshop became the standard. And once you learn the way a program works, you don't want to have to relearn the way another program works. Often it is as simple as which key combinations you have to press. Once you have mastered one program, you don't want to have to go back and relearn how to accomplish the same thing in another program.

There is one other big difference. Photoshop has always been far ahead of Paint Shop Pro in standardizing what colors you see on a photo no matter what monitor or computer you are using to view the photo. PSP only recently started trying to make this a priority.

For someone sending their work to LIFE magazine, this is important. For someone sending photos to Walgreens.com or making a shutterfly book for family and friends, it is not. All of the photo printers have software that corrects that sort of thing.

In the end it is fairly simple. If you need photoshop, get it. You will KNOW if you NEED it. If you aren't sure, then you don't need Photoshop. If you think you need PhotoShop, you probably DON'T need it. If $500 is chump change to you, then go ahead and get photoshop. If you make a living sending photos to major publications, get photoshop.

On the other hand, if $500 is a lot of money to you, get Paint Shop Pro. It is a super powerful photo editing program that has the power of photoshop under the hood, but with the ease of use that you would expect from a much less powerful program. You truly get the best of both worlds with Paint Shop Pro!

Low price, ease of use and many automated picture fixing options, yet you also have the power of layers, curves and white balancing no so much more if you are willing to learn how to use them. This is truly a bargain priced program that does virtually everything PS does (and some things it does better) at a fraction of the cost.",0
it is what it says it is.,0
"Installs very easily and installs as a new version; so if you have an older version, it will still be there to use (or delete).  It is easy to use, especially if you had a previous version. Good cards and verses.  The weakest link in this program is its graphics.  Compared to other card programs, Hallmark's graphics are ok.  Some graphics remind you of the 50s pictures.  But there are a lot of graphics that can be used.  I have been using the program for many years and am satisfied with the results.",0
"I started using this software immediately after ordering it and got into the habit of using it so quickly, I forgot it was a Vine item.  I would have paid for this software.

It's a package deal for editing and organizing still photos and videos.  I confess I haven't played with the video editing much, but the photo editing is spectacular in regard to the appearance of the user interface, flexibility of viewing, ease of use, and so many editing features!

I'm also playing with layers for fractal art I've created.  There is so much one can do with this software.  I've had it over a year and still haven't tried everything.  I love it, and you will too.",0
"When I am looking for internet security software I want to know 2 things:

1. Is it going to slow down my computer
2. Do all: a. Firewall b. Antivirus c. Spyware of its programs work--and work well

When I ask myself these questions and go by experience and 3rd party testing I go back to the same product. That product is Bitdefender. Because other, highly advertised, brands get the 'recognition' so that people normally assume that products like McAfee and Norton are better. I feel that the reason most people tend to stick with those popular brands are because it involves computers and technology--areas that some people lack know-how in, so they are left with brand names. Also with internet security software, most companies seem to not be able to get themselves out there on the shelves of megastores around the globe. I have not seen Bitdefender there. Thankfully people come to Amazon to look at reviews, and hopefully Bitdefender will be somewhere down the list of bestsellers so that people can come and read more about a product that they are not familiar with, but should be.

Now from experience with brands such as McAfee and Norton, I can tell you that it felt, when using my computer, that I had a security software installed. This is not a good thing. The reason I could tell is because a. annoying popups, about almost every other program I was opening, would minimize screens or litter the viewing area and b. because my computer would lag sometimes for no reason whether it was updating or not--and when I would open up the task manager, guess what was taking all of the computer memory...the security software was! It was not until I switched to Bitdefender that those laggy problems ceased. Especially with the new 2010 internet security my computer feels completely free of any software of the like and runs as if it weren't running at all.

The recommended system requirements are:

Windows XP SP2, Vista or Windows 7
600MB Free Space
Intel CORE Duo (1.66GHz) or equivalent
1GB of RAM with Win 7 and XP or 1.5GB with Vista

If your computer is greatly underneath those, it might not run as smooth as the one I'm reviewing. I wanted to add that I have a 64-bit computer and the disc that came with retail package says that it installs either 32bit or 64bit (automatically depending on your computer) HOWEVER it did not work for me. After I installed the program it made everything on my computer run slow, including videos, while the operation ""vsserv.exe"" would take up all of my CPU. The solution I found was to manually download the 64bit Internet Security 2010 from Bitdefenders website and use the key for the box on it. After that it worked flawlessly.
The link to that version is: [...]
That should fix any problems for 64bit users.

The interface I give 5 stars:

1. it still gives the option of viewing the control center in either Novice, Intermediate or Advanced view--whichever suits
you best (you can switch the option at anytime).
2. A superior parental control function to block unwanted website viewing and/or limit time spent on internet. Very versatile function.
3. Networking with other home computers that allows you to control all of the Bitdefender software on all your computers from the ""master"". Great for families.

For the features I also give it 5 stars:

I said above that I ask whether the security software worked and if it worked well. It may be that Norton and McAfee are more popular, but does it mean they are better? According to PC World, Bitdefender had a 98.9% Scan Detection rate rating the HIGHEST out of the big names (including McAfee and Norton), as well as scoring higher in the proactive detection (protecting in real time).

Bitdefender also offers an optimizing function to speed up your PC performance, and is equipped with Laptop Mode (meaning it purposely takes up less resources and/or limits updating so that it doesn't use as much battery life) and Gaming Mode (quick way to set up the firewall so that you aren't limited when playing online and doesn't scan or update while you are playing--so no lag or glitches).

I love this product and have always been a loyal Bitdefender user since switching to it. It looks like it has not changed over the years but has only distanced itself away from companies that have to rely on their brand to keep the sales up, instead of performance. Give this one a try--you won't look back.",0

This software does not consume resources and is quite fast.,0
"Been using TurboTax for some time now. It can be a little confusing at first, but if you stick with it, it will gather all your information and put it where it's supposed to be. It helps to have last year's tax return to make sure you have everything the first time you use the program. Then, the following years TurboTax will keep your previous year's return data and you just update the items that have changed. You can ask questions, but I have not had success with the TurboTax customer support, probably better off asking the community. Good record keeping and having all your information updated and handy is a plus. Good luck!",0
"I have been using this software for several years to do my tax returns.  The download was quick and easy.  It resides in my Amazon account in case I need to use it the future which is a great feature.  As customary, Amazon.com has the best pricing.  Data entry was efficient and without any problems.  This year I compared it to Tax Act.  H&R Block was much easier to use and did not require, unlike Tax Act, any manipulation to arrive at the correct computation. Tax Act to its credit did provide more detailed information than H&R Block in a couple of less common areas. Overall, H&R Block is less expensive than Turbo Tax and easier to use than Tax Act.",0
"For those who have the software and like printing their own checks, it is hard to beat this huge pack of check paper. For a laser printer, they work well with the correct software.

"I downloaded a trial version of this a few months ago on my son's laptop which does not have DVD. I was interested in this product to manage my ebay business and a small bake shop. I don't need payroll or other robust features that a larger business would use, but I did need to track inventory and the sales invoices, orders, and time and expense allow me to get a pretty accurate overview of my actual costs in the bake shop.

I was unable to install this package on my pc as it's from my fulltime job, and I'm unable to install certain files (this requires updates to .NET and C# files that my IT dept won't allow me to modify.) It's the only pc we have with a DVD drive. I plan to get a new pc soon and will get a dvd drive as well, and will update later. Based on the trial version that I used for 30 days, I am confident this will suit my small business needs.",0

"I used two of these to WDS bridge two Asus wl-520gu routers together and it worked great! Very stable connection if using Tomato firmware with transmit power set to around 80.  If the two antennas have a clear view of each other, there should be zero problem in getting a rock solid connection.  Make sure you buy the correct antenna cable to hook up to your router as this package does not come with it.",0

"I needed some simple switches not too long ago to place in low volume traffic areas.  A prime concern was price, and these fit the bill quite nicely.

Although there are only three connections to the switches that I placed, they are expected to handle some rather large transfers at times - they are connected to networked printers in the premises, as well as to a networked copy controller.  I have not seen any issues with them since their installation, and they look decent enough to not cause any raised eyebrows when they are in plain sight.  Time will obviously tell how well they last, but considering that a similarly placed ""name brand"" switch recently gave up the ghost after 8 months, these have more than paid for themselves by now.",0
"I've been using this for a couple months now, and have found that I have actually eliminated many other programs that I used to use, as this suite is so chock full of content, everything else seems obsolete.

There is a lot going on here, as this version of CorelDRAW is the cream of the crop.  It works very well with the Windows 7 interface, and is fully customizable.  Install only what you need, but if you're like me, I dabble in most everything it offers for subject matter.

I have designed web sites for years, and through these years, there have been many fill-in-the-blank type web site creators.  The web site creation feature alone is worth the money, and perfect if you are not no familiar with programming. In my case, I liked creating with this feature, but the ability to edit anything I want. However, it comes with so many templates and images, you are good to go for your first ever web site, if that is the case.  Soon you will add more to your sites with the Swish program, adding flash animations and text.

Photographers will not only adapt well to the image creation and editing features, but will appreciate the organization of a huge collection of work that would otherwise be hard to navigate.  If you have a mess of photos, and not a pro, even better.  It helps you get to a higher level as you save much higher quality work.

Video Studio is perfect for the aspiring YouTube star that wants to take their audience to the next level. But with the resources and features provided, you could become an avid filmmaker. And if you are already a pro making movies, this program simply makes a lot of aspects much easier. The video effects and the ease of adding music and textual elements are top notch.  And everything is easily uploaded directly from the program, or you can create a stunning DVD presentation.

There are plenty of tools and features that you may think you will not use, but once installed, you will be noticing that these elements are merely incorporated in your work.  The portability of files and sharing is much easier with the industry standard in WinZip Pro which will become your default choice in file compression.  But you will appreciate the organization ability of all these programs on your system with customized toolbars, thumbnail and preview features, and there is no reason to be overwhelmed with the fear of having to learn it all.  If you are like me, you learn by doing. But the fact that there is over two hours of training videos on DVD as well as a plethora of helpful resources on their web sites, this has got to be the user-friendliest suite for the artist in anyone.  I highly recommend this for children as well. If there is a glimmer of an artist in their eye, this is worth the investment.",0
Excellent upgrade that installs easily and is very compatible with Windows 10. This is a good way to go if you're running an older version of Microsoft Office and don't want to pay the cost for the newest version.,0
"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.",0
Received as expected,0
I have been using this for two weeks and have encountered no problems.  The only difference I have noted from 2015 is the length of time for updating takes a little longer. I just go get a cup of coffee.,0
"My first experience with Dragon Naturally was with Dragon Naturally Speaking 10 Preferred and it was OK overall but I gave up on it after a short run. I spent at least 40 minutes training it the first session, then I did additional trainings and it never was quite right. The commands seemed hard to implement on the fly. I figured that version 11--and the Home version at that--wouldn't be that much improvement.

I was so wrong. It feels like a completely different process than my first try. I installed the program, clicked on a few settings, and did a quick medium difficulty reading (JFK's Inaugural Speech) to train the software. I happen to have a slight Boston area accent, but it's not as strong as JFK's. That was it. I thought I totally missed something. That was the training?

I decided to test it on a fiction story I'm writing by dictating instead of my normal typing. I have to say, I am really impressed. It's like a totally new experience. I did 1500 words in half the time it takes me to type. I had to fix a couple blatant mistakes; I left a couple small errors to fix later (my typing usually has more errors). I used the ""dialogue box"" to redo a homonym several times.

*Deleting the last phrase, no problem.
*Go to next line or paragraph, no problem.
*Find a word/phrase in the dictated text to change, no problem.
*Enter ""quote"", no problem.
*Enter punctuation, no problem.

I was really tickled. Maybe Dragon does work as well as some people say it does. It did for me and right out of the box. I would've never believed it after my last experience.

[Note: I used DNS 10 Pro with Vista the last time, this time I'm using DNS 11 Home with Windows 7]",0
"The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October. If you are updating from Leopard, Apple has continued to make it inexpensive for a family using more than one machine by pricing the upgrade at about $10.00 a machine (assuming you use all five). Not bad.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!",0
"This USB hub works just fine, and I love the design.

My Dell 1905FP is an excellent LCD monitor.  The default ICM profile made it appear a bit too bright and/or harsh but the color was fine.  After calibrating it with this it looks MUCH better.  Colors appear natural and in the correct balance.  I now make prints that are very close to matching what I see on the monitor whereas before it was pretty much a trial and error process.  Highly recommended for digital photographers.,0

"I have been using Windows 7 for over a month now. (Received an early copy) I must admit the upgrade experience is a hassle but once you install Windows 7 you will be pleasantly surprised. I recommend a clean install for all users. Windows 7 has a noticeably snappier boot time than Windows Vista. What users will notice most are the changes to the interface. It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions. Windows 7 also includes a comprehensive device drivers, I have only had an issue with an old printer where Windows 7 could not find the drivers. But with Virtual XP this was no problem, I simply installed the Virtual XP, and used my printer within the virtualized environment. I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used.

Improvements/Pros/New Features
-New Taskbar interface, each program is represented by an icon for a clutter free taskbar
-Quicker boot times
-Comprehensive driver library
-Supports many devices out of the box
-Less annoying
-Virtual XP (for those who still need Windows XP)
-Networking

Recommendations
-Microsoft Security Essentials: A free antivirus program provided by Microsoft that fights viruses, spyware, rootkits, and Trojans. This program is a separate installation, and is also compatible with XP, Vista, and 7.

-Ninite: Free program that provides easy PC Setup, and helps to install Multiple Applications at once. Is a lifesaver for Windows 7 upgrades. Caveat, limited to popular programs such as pidgin, flash, firefox, skype, itunes",0
"We have several relatives that live quite far away and don't have access to the internet. For years now I've been creative DVDs of pictures and movies for them to watch on their DVD players which has worked out well, but is often a time-consuming process on my end. A few years ago I started using PowerDirector and I was impressed. Year after year PowerDirector has been improved to the point where creating DVDs is a quick and almost enjoyable process.

I've used more expensive programs in the past, particularly Adobe Premiere... PowerDirector isn't quite as accurate and is missing a few features, however it's faster and easier to put together videos. I'm not looking to edit a blockbuster movie and what PowerDirector offers is perfect. My DVDs are usually just a picture slideshow with brief sections of videos in between. It's a simple drag and drop to add the pictures and videos and from there videos can be edited and effects can be added.

For the price, I can't find anything better.",0

"on the life-cycle of this item & the other vista versions aswell & if ur one of the xp users out there who have been afraid to upgrade to windows 7 or 8, then this item is for u.., u'll need service packs 1 & 2 for this item after installing it & some versions alredy include sp1 & if u get a version with sp1 included - then u'll only need to download & install sp2, - but its comparable to windows 7 & it'll give a person the chance to get the feel of a newer operating system before upgrading to 7 or 8.., - just make sure u get a sealed copy before purchasing - if the description on isn't clear about it being a sealed copy or not - then ask the seller to be sure before buying ! ..

 NOTE: lately i've seen some copies of this software thats marked "" OPEN BOX ""  & sometimes that just means that its been opened for display only & it can still be activated after its been installed,  ASK THE SELLER if thats the case before buying cuz if is the case - then u can still get a good price on an open-box item if the software hasn't been activated & the key is still included  - BUT other times the keys to those packages have been lost & they cant be used again - even if someone says u can buy a new vista key,  microsoft no-longer sells new keys for vista to the best of my knoledge - just do the research by asking the seller ! ..",0

"To test features of the new Dragon Dictate for Mac, I decided to dictate this entire review using the program. Any typos or mistakes in the review is a result of the program and not my typing. I used a previous dictation software in the early 2000s and was less than impressed with its ability to accurately type what I was saying. I thought it was time to give dictation software another try. The package comes with the install software, a quick start guide, and a USB microphone. The install took 2.3 GB of disk space. The system requirements are fairly hefty so make sure your computer can tow the line.  My test compute was a MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory and a 2.4 GHz Intel core I five processor. After the installation, you will create a profile. You will then go through voice training where you will read a story and the software will get used to your voice. After voice training, you will run through very useful tutorial which has a series of lessons to help you learn the intricacies of the software.
I was very impressed on how quickly it typed what you said. In my testing and along with this review my accuracy was close to 98%. This percentage is much better than I would get if I were typing.

The Nuance website has a number of helpful videos to help you get started in your dictation. While in command mode, you can view a list of all the things that you can say. I found this very helpful.  You can also add your own commands. The program is very easy to use, however, it will take me a while to fully utilize all its capabilities. You can also go to the Nuance website and add extensions for both Safari and Firefox.

The software was very stable. You can also use the software to transcribe an audio recording. I had no problems learning the basic voice commands. My days of hunting and pecking on the keyboard will be fewer and fewer.",0
"I wrote in my review of Norton Internet Security 2008 that I used the product - but despised it.  The hit to my system's resources was just too great, and I turned much of it off as a result.

Be aware that the engines underlying Internet Security 2009 and Norton 360 are reported to be different, with 360 using the older version (i.e., performance problems).",0

It does take a little getting used to especially with punctuation but the system is very smart and does not require you to talk like a robot. As long as you enunciate the words reasonably well 99% of the time it will recognize the word correctly.

"I have been a TurboTax user for years; in fact, I just checked and I have TurboTax files from 1999!
This, the Basic edition, does not come with a state editionwhich is a let-down for me since I live in a state which requires a state tax return.
The installation is very straightforward and since I am already a TurboTax user from years past, it is very easy to import last year's files and everything is filled out already. Very handy, especially if your work situation has remained the same.

I have found TurboTax to extremely thorough for 99% of the situations; it goes through just about every possible scenario and the only time I would suggest hiring a professional is if you are in a very complicated situation, with wills, trusts, retirement accounts and so forth, but I would still attempt to use TurboTax to serve as a check on the professional's work. Yes, it is that good.

Filing is easy, free, and straightforward. You're kept abreast of every step (the IRS has accepted your return, etc.) and are notified by email and text. Documentation can be accessed at any time, and it's copious. Even complicated tax information is clearly documented if you are willing to take the time to read. For the DIY-er, TurboTax is a boon, best in class.

TurboTax has taken everything into consideration, it even helps you estimate the value of donated items. A very rigorous error checking takes place before you file; it also includes the risk you run of getting audited while offering (paid) services to help you if the risk is high.
Four and a half stars because it's missing the state returnwhich, while it is available for download, is quite expensive on its own.",0

I recently added to my family and wanted to get a decent software package to record my little-ones and our vacation.  I was pretty hesitant about going back to PSP, but I really am glad that I did.

You really don't have to have much experience with photo editing with PSP--it will walk you through your task and yet let you customize your project so that it doesn't end up looking like a corny photo Christmas card from Walgreens.

The differences from the version I had years ago against todays version (X6) is profound to say the least.  You can load HUGE files on your system without any freezing, also, the interface is really simplified without dumbing it down for a newbie user that would limit someone with some experience in photo editing.  And by the way, if you are a newbie, this is a GREAT program to start with anyways--you'll be a pro in no time, and, average users may consider their career options towards graphics.

There are so many incredible features to this version, I would have to write several pages on the features/benefits themselves.  But, here's a few diamonds:

-Faster HDR Rendering
-FASTER preformance
-All new and VERY helpful video tutorials
-Auto-fix tools
-Adds any type of effect you can imagine
-Retouches photos to remove red-eyes and even wrinkles (I look 10 years younger:)

And those above are just a few great enhances that Corel has made to the PSP 6X version.

Overall, you get a whole lot of bang for your buck on this program.  I have never come across a photo editing software program that comes close to this.

Oh, BTW, each software box comes with FREE membership for updates, creative content, & other offers.

"After trying various security software, I reached the conclusion Kaspersky was the best.  But now I think Bitdefender is as good, and possibly even better.  This Bitdefender security suite downloaded, installed and updated with no problems.  Unlike my Kaspersky, which was just the anti-virus version, the Bitdefender has a firewall and does PC maintenance, too.  It also blocks others from sharing, if you have an unsecured wireless network.  Like Kaspersky, I also think it discovers more threats than other security software.  And this version of Bitdefener lasts two years and covers three PCs!  What could be better?",0

"This is an inexpensive way to upgrade a suitable older computer to the new Windows 8 operating system.  So far, I like Windows 8 quite a bit.  It is simple, intuitive and attractive/comfortable.  It makes me feel like I did back in the Mac. System 7 days, before the downward Mac. spiral to dysfunctional systems.  No, it is not similar in any way to the old Mac. Sys. 7, but it feels a bit like it.  Since that was the peak of Mac. systems, then this new Windows 8 operating system can certainly be said to be among the best yet.  Good work MS.",0

"Sony usually has excellent software to bring to the table, and they're keeping that trend going with the Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite. Installed on a Microsoft Windows 8 Professional machine with an Intel Core i7 processor, this editing suite is super stable and leverages the multi-core and hyper-threading features very well making this suite very efficient and fast.

The various editing tasks are assigned to their own editing programs within the suite, making each editing task such as audio, video, and so-forth more focused with better working features that aren't just all clumped together and inefficient. Sony allows you to focus on the specific task at hand without distractions, and the navigation through the various settings and tools is very intuitive and easy.

If you do a lot of video editing, this suite will end up saving you a lot of time in the long run because of it's efficient and well laid out design that lends itself to a smoother workflow. Bear in mind, however that is a more simplified, consumer oriented suite that is meant to provide with both the basics and quite a few extras, without over-encumbering the suite with a lot of professional level features that most people wouldn't be able to take advantage of, but also without stripping out too many of the features, making this a very well balanced editing suite perfect for the beginner and advanced hobbyist alike.",0
"Willmaker Plus was exactly what my family and I needed to prepare for an unexpected death.  It took you step by step and for anyone who has used a tax prep program will find the format similar.  It asks you questions to see what is pertinent to your situation and prompts you for the information that you need.  What was really helpful was that you could stop and save and pick it up at a later date.  This was nice since I didn't have all of the info I needed at my fingertips so I was able to get that, then pick up where I left off.

Even if you have more complex arrangements to make, especially in the case of divorce I think you will find that Willmaker Plus will cover you needs.  One thing that we needed was a promissory note in addition to just a will and I was sooo happy that that option was also included into this program as well.  It covered everything that we needed and make a not so pleasant task easy.  I highly recommend it.  It installed easily, and was easy to use.  I would buy it again without any hesitation!",0

"GUEST REVIEWER - ! MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;-b

I have used other internet security programs in the past and they were OK.  But, I find Kaspersky products to be the best.  I am a true fan of Kaspersky especially since they don't bog down your computer--they are quick to load and VERY easy to use.  In the past sometimes when I would load other software, I would then have a problem with my security software.  I have not encountered this problem with Kaspersky.  The screens are very easy to navigate and nice features to completing protect your computer.  I highly recommend this product.",0

Have used this software for years now. My whole family does. Find it doesn't take away from the computers performance. Have kept our computers virus free.,0
"I need to rewrite my review based on what has been said.  BitDefender Total Security 2009 so far has been great for me.  It got rid of viruses that infected one of our computers while it ran McAfee, which I decided to try since it is free from my internet provider.  I tried to clean my computer with McAfee and TrendMicro before I purchased a copy BitDefender 2009 (the virus blocked access to all security web sites so I could not try free copies).  I purchased the copy based on my previous year's experience, where I used a free copy of BitDefender 2008 to clean up my child's computer so that I could install TrendMicro 2008.  I had already paid for TrendMicro 2008, but it could not clean up the computer enough for successful installation.

Secondly, any security software can cause problems.  My employer only buys certain computers and does extensive testing before allowing any software on a computer.  An individual can do that, but its lots of work.  Or an individual can try free evaluations of security software and find one that works.  All security software companies offer free evaluation copies for 15 to 30 days.  Try what you want before purchasing

Thirdly, the problem with update KB954430 is not caused by BitDefender per se (as stated by one reviewer), or is a problem with all security software.  I developed that problem while using McAfee.  Microsoft says the cause is ""Different versions of MSXML are included with various Microsoft products, such as Windows, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft SQL Server, and some third-party products.""  [...] which also has an abbreviated solution and a link to a detailed solution)  Granted, this may be ""third party products."" I found one reference directly blaming BitDefender while I found many sites blaming Norton.

Last, people need to have reasonable expectations.  I have only seen high quality customer support once on software that costs less than [...] . I contacted BitDefender (which is under $100) once and got a very technical ""solution"" for a problem that was not even their fault.  For something this inexpensive  that is all I can ask.  I do not expect them to hold my hand.

I feel BitDefender 2009 is the best software to try first since it offers great protection for a great price and relative to other software, except Kapersky, has the best chance of working on your computer.",0
"I was truly surprised with what 'MiniTool Partion Wizard' free edition was capable of doing.

"After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 2011 instead.  The download took less than a minute and installed quickly with no problems at all.  H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax but since I'd had so much trouble with Turbo and was concerned that it might get this year's instead, I started from scratch with adding our information.  The whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes.  It was able to handle the HSA account info accurately and without a glitch.  This was what had caused the problem with Turbo.  It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately.  I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out.  Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward.  I'll be using H&R Block from now on.",0
"This is about as perfect as it gets. This is my second year using this software (as opposed to QuickBooks). I loved it the first year I used it and continue to feel likewise with this newest version.

It is a snap to install, seems ""bug"" free (at least as of right now and following some pretty serious use), and it is incredibly intuitive/easy to use. In fact, the ease of this program is a time-saver for me ... and that means more time with me family. And, that is invaluable!

This is expertly developed, phenomenally well-tested, and worth every penny!

Bravo to Sage for making a product that consumers can truly invest their trust in!",0
"Review is for the product, not the price.  I think it's overpriced for the lack of features compared to the windows version, so I'm looking at this strictly from the application standpoint.

I've used quicken and money varying between products since the inception of both.  But I'm one of the people who simply wants a place to keep tabs of my checking information.  I never used it for investments, for writing checks or bill pay.  So for me, I was getting a ton of features in previous versions when I was using Windows thatI never touched, and for me just cluttered up everything.

I was happy when they announced the Mac essentials version coming out this year, since I just transitioned from over 20 years of windows use to my first macbook last summer.  And while I have windows 7 running in fusion and boot camp, I wanted my financial stuff to be in the same OS as the rest of my personal things...  So I ran Ibank for the interim period, and while it suited my needs, it wasn't able to download from my bank directly, so I was manually marking things as cleared and such by comparing it to my online bank website.  Pain.  Even in the 2009 version I had in Windows of Quicken, that one also couldn't directly connect and download my data for me.  I had to download the files from my bank and then import them to quicken 2009...

Since all my bill pay is free through my bank, and I actually like the interface, I've become accustomed to that as my way of paying everything.  I haven't had paper checks in about 6 years now, so being unable to print a check from this version doesn't hinder me at all.  And since I could not directly connect with any previous version of quicken to my bank, not being able to just pay bills directly from quicken isn't a drawback for me since I never did it before.  No matter what I did previously, I had to do things in multiple locations.  For me this is the ""norm"".

The interface is nice.  I like the uncluttered feel.  It starts very quickly, unlike my 2009 quicken for windows, or even Ibank on my mac.  I instantly can see the main info.  I also like on top the ability to, with a single click, change the view from my actual balance to the online balance.  That way it's easy for me to see what hasn't cleared yet, and make sure the numbers add up.

Quick and easy on the eyes overview page, and I like the category explorer.  Makes it easy to get a good view of the last span of whatever length of time you pick.

All I wanted to track with this was my checking accounts, which I can do easier and more clearly than with any other version of money management software.  Drag and drop matching is nice too when it updates with my bank and doesn't match the proper entry and rather creates a duplicate.

If you have simple needs like me, this is a great app.  Pricey, but i'm happy with it even for the price since for the first time I can actually do the things I wanted to do all along.  If you need more complexity, avoid it like the plague, but if you're like me, it's fantastic.",0
"I needed some simple switches not too long ago to place in low volume traffic areas.  A prime concern was price, and these fit the bill quite nicely.

Although there are only three connections to the switches that I placed, they are expected to handle some rather large transfers at times - they are connected to networked printers in the premises, as well as to a networked copy controller.  I have not seen any issues with them since their installation, and they look decent enough to not cause any raised eyebrows when they are in plain sight.  Time will obviously tell how well they last, but considering that a similarly placed ""name brand"" switch recently gave up the ghost after 8 months, these have more than paid for themselves by now.",0
"....Core Duo with 2GB of ram I can run Windows Vista. I am having to allocate 1 GB of ram to get reasonable performance. I do not dedicate both ""cores"" to VM Fusion, but I will caution you that performance on the Mac side will be sluggish on a machine like this while running VMWare.

But, let's think about this. I have a machine that was the cheapest mac sold about 4 years ago. I installed and set up Windows Vista without a single hitch. Everything works out of the box. Consider the complaints you hear about Vista (fair or not). I am running it fine, no problems at all.

The applications I am running are fairly simple. No Solidworks or other 3D software. No games. Just IE, Microsoft office, Camtasia and a few other things. It fills in the gaps for things I need to test out, not owning a ""real PC"".

Should you get this? Do you need to run windows apps with no fuss, and decent performance? Don't want to deal with setting up boot camp, and want both your Mac and ""PC"" available at the same time? Would like like to share folders between machines, and generally not have to mess around with a real PC? How about this -- be able to run pre-made computer OS images so that you can try out stuff like Ubuntu or Drupal without have to install anything? I wanted to test OLPC's Sugar interface, so I found a prebuilt image for VMWare and just ran it -- bingo -- I have a OLCP test machine for web content.

This is well worth owning if you answered yes to any of the questions above.",0

"Twenty years ago I taught architectural design at the high-school level.  When I think back to how we had to do it then--and how it can be done now with programs like ""Home Designer"" I can only shake my head at the marvels of technology.

Having written that--I do need to point out that while this program can be used by beginners--it sure helps if you have some previous knowledge in architectural design.  If you don't and are interested in learning it--this program will help you--but it requires a time commitment.  There are a lot of videos that take you step by step through the process.  I would agree with an earlier reviewer that it would be nice to ALSO have written directions (perhaps a pdf file if they don't want to include a printed manual).  This way you can view the video to see the steps--but then refer to the written directions when you need them.  Otherwise, it is time consuming to try to find the video section of the direction you need.

If you are a beginner and hoping you can install this and quickly be designing a specific real-life home project you may be a bit disappointed.  It will take some time to understand the program and be able to input the specific information for your project.

Overall, this is a very good program.",0

"Power Director 11 is a a nice upgrade from Power Director 10. I had several crashes trying to use Power Director 10, but haven't experienced the same problem with Power Director 11. I did have one problem trying to load a long video where the software seemed to quit. I stopped the program, restarted and had no more problems.

The creative packs that come on Disc 2 are wonderful. The software decides how to segment your movie and add interesting animation and music. I was very impressed. Sometimes I like to make my own edits and add additional material, but the packs make it easy to make a professional looking video with much less work. They are particularly useful for holiday and special occasion videos like weddings.

I liked Power Director 10 for all the effects. Power Director 11 is even better. Some of the bugs have been removed and for me, the program worked beautifully. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a video editing program with lots of flexibility.",0
"This is the first time that I have used Cyberlink PowerDirector.  it was super easy to install but it takes a huge amount of room, and you rellly need to have a powerful computer.  i was able to do a few things right away,  and I am still learning about the many things it can do.  I have been a Corel user for a long time, but this last upgrade has made using Corel nearly impossible so I am happy for a change.

"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product.",0

"OK, written as a ""first reviewer but still reviewing"" I'm wiped out by the FINALLY open PC apps that this is running without any problems, but I'm pushin' it.

Run windows -finally- well while running OS X, but you'll require a newer, faster Intel-based Apple for speed ad stamina.  A bit slower on the startup but expected. for me, running Windows apps from work at home is a very big deal, and here we are, running fine.

I've received emails from people moving up from an earlier version of VMware but really, no problems on my new MB at all, but sooner or later, I push 'em and I'll certainly rewrite any review if and when I find a fatal flaw.

Using add-ons like the GPS system I use but relied on my wife's laptop PC for is now under my control.
Using some of the photo priniting stuff that kodak made that works so well on her PC runs on my MB. so far, so good.

Apple is superior! VM Fusion is AWESOME!",0
"I have been waiting for the new update of the Mac version of Office. I have tried other alternatives, and they just don't work the way I would expect them to. Having used Microsoft Office for the PC in the past for all of my office needs, I could not find anything that worked quite the same on my Mac. Printing would be off, or text would not look right, and just a lot of small things that made me feel that I needed to keep looking for the right program to edit spreadsheets and documents on my Mac.

Behold: Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac! This is the newest version of Office for the mac! The settings and options I am used to having are all there! Commands have the same name I am familiar with! Documents and text look the way I would expect them to when I create/edit them and even when I print them! I felt at home!

The menu system does take a bit of getting used to. Instead of being a traditional Menu Bar like Office 2003 (what I am familiar with) it has a style more like Office 2007 - but with the menus detached from the main document window. This takes a little getting used to, but actually is much better with my wide screen monitor. I still prefer the old Office 2003 style menus, but I would say these are a bit more useful then the ones present in Office 2007. Also, the update system can be annoying if you set it to always check for updates. I get a pop-up window every time, but would have preferred if it checked in the background and then just let me know when new updates were available.

Installation took a bit. Not too terribly slow, but it was a bit time consuming. All of this was well worth it though, as any Office program I run starts up very fast! I was impressed with the loading speeds. I expected fairly fast loading due to the major efforts put into the new Microsoft products to decrease loading times, but I still expected it to take a bit longer. Word or Excel load about as fast as Firefox or any other lean program! MUCH faster than an alternative I had been using previously.

After using alternatives, and having become accustomed to the PC version - I found Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac to be a wonderful and necessary software suite for all of my document needs. I would definitely recommend this program if you want a solid and fully featured Office program for your Mac!",0
"I've used Windows 95, 98 and 2000.  I've also used an OS 9 and 10 Mac.  None of them matches Windows XP.  It is simply the best, hands down.  I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. I'm also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and I'm even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And that's just one of many special programs that I've used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they haven't developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.  As my giant file cabinet, it is very easy for me to keep everything organized in WE and the thumbnails of my jpgs, tifs, ais, htms and so forth are terrific.  The task bar is much improved from 2000 and I found I could even get rid of my pop up remover program because XP makes it so easy to close multiple browser windows with one right click on the task bar on a grouped browser window button. I also get beautiful thumbnails now when I use right click.  There is a wonderful XP magazine that comes from the UK (called simply Windows XP) that I would love to see Amazon have available for subscription.  This magazine has a wonderful users forum online that is a great help if you need help with XP.",0

"It's been a number of years since I used WordPerfect, because my first word processor program was Microsoft Word, version 1.0.

I think my favorite version of Word was 3.0, which was the version that finally convinced my employer to ditch WordPerfect and go Microsoft for everything.

During the last several years, however, Microsoft has been changing course. Their operating system has altered, but, worse yet, Office has become very difficult to use for me and, alas, has persuaded me to try WordPerfect. Result?

I love it. After Shot is a nice benefit, but it is the seamless ease of use that is much more intuitive than Word that wins me over. I intend to spend a great deal of time learning the key sequences that will enable me to become more professional in producing my handbooks and procedures at work, and in writing my reviews for Amazon.

I'll not bore you with a detailed review, for I see several excellent reviews already posted. Just take my word for it, WordPerfect makes document preparation, er, writing, fun again.

Five stars out of five. No, this doesn't imply perfection. It is a statement of my delight with a product and it's simplicity and functionality.",0

"it's the same BS that Microsoft has been dumping on their customers since day one!  One more example to prove that Microsoft really should not be in the technology business and instead should consider, maybe, tree farming.

Describe Windows 7... how about annoying, painful, frustrating, stupid(!), slow, and even abusive to you, the user.

If you're using XP you'll have to do a clean install.  That means you have to re-load all your software, set up all your settings, deal with drivers, etc.  This is going to take all weekend or longer to do.  Thanks to Microsoft millions of people are losing more of their valuable time.  Microsoft does not care about you or your time.  If you have Vista - you're most likely also going to have to do a clean install.  It is recommended by the experts either way.

The user interface borrows (takes) *some* of the good ideas Apple came up with, but then instead of advancing those design ideas, Microsoft actually makes them worse.  I clearly attended more design classes than the GUI designers at Microsoft - or at least I made better grades than they obviously did - and I was a Poly-sci major.  It really is mind-blowing how bad it is.

Fast?  Hell no.  Example: right-mouse click on a desktop item and you'll be waiting, waiting, waiting for the menu to appear.

Notice that all the crack-smoking, cool-aid drinking, folks who leave good reviews of this crappy OS say things like, ""it's a big improvement over Vista"" or otherwise compare this version of Windows to older versions of Windows - as if one should have expected this new version to *not* have improved after multiple years of development.  Doesn't that speak volumes to Microsoft and their products; and what people - even those who support Microsoft - really think?!?

Buy a Mac.  You're going to have to re-install all that software anyway.  You can ""dual-boot"" a Mac so you have both worlds.  I still use PCs - but I have to - if you don't, then buy a Mac.  It'll save you time, money, and frustration.  I tell this to my family members and my sister took my word on it.  She told me the other day, ""I love, love, love, my Mac.  For the first time in my life I get home from work and actually look forward to turning on my computer.""

"I'll start off by saying I'm not an Office power user.  I use Office at work on PC's and wanted to use the same product at home on the Mac.  I primarily use Word and Excel.

There is a learning curve when switching between the two products, I suspect that is mostly my inexperience with the Mac.  I am able to do everything with this version that I can with the Office suite I use at work, and it's mostly pretty intuitive.

Overall I am very pleased with this product as it allows me to transport files between work and home.",0
"Ok, this is the Nancy Drew game that I haven't beaten...yet. It is freaky yet interesting, in a way. Ok, so you have bad dreams, and you hear noices, and things, but there IS a slide involved! You'll find that out once you get the game. I like this game, even though it's a ""little on the spooky side"" as Nancy takes to calling it. Can you figure out why Eleanor, supposedly the witch in the family of the Penvellyns, or the beast of blackmoor, just came around and ""popped in for a visit?""

QNAP has one of the best reputations in the industry for quality and workmanship.  This has an extremely low power draw and I've acheived write speeds of 65 MB a second over gigabit ethernet which is far greater than USB 2.0 (roughly 25 MB a second).

This product is half the price of a TS-459 Pro+ ($900 before tax).

I bought all enterprise drives for additional reliability (WD RE4) I'm currently upgrading to Hitachi Ultrastar 3 TB drives.  The new firmware (3.4) from QNAP provides support 3 TB drives.  So max would be 6 TB for Raid-1, 12 TB for (JBOD, RAID 0), and somewhere inbetween for Raid 5.

"I absolutely enjoyed using Sony Movie Studio 13 suite.  It installed without any grief and was intuitively simple to use considering I've used several similar applications and am becoming increasingly skilled with many apps included within my Adobe CC subscription.

Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite is aimed for the audience who is more into social media (it's very easy to share completed videos directly to FB!)  If you don't need some less used pro level tools of Premiere Pro (and After Effects), and want to OWN the software instead of leasing it at approximately $50 / month, then Sony Movie Studio is definitely worth a consideration.

The included Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 is an added bonus for editing, mixing and blending audio tracks. The vocal eraser allows karaoke tunes to be created from more traditional audio sources.  My audiophile spouse was VERY pleased with the audio recording and editing ability - not exactly my area of expertise, but if he's happy then I'm happy.",0

I have used H&R tax software since before the company used it and it was called Tax Cut.  I have always been happy with it but I have so many years of experience I prefer not to use the interview method of form completion for everything.  Having error and consistency checks is useful..  It is also good to have some forewarning if deductions might prompt an audit, although in the end you still need to put down the correct information even if it means dealing with the IRS later to defend what is claimed.

I would go back to doing my tax returns entirely by hand and calculator before spending the much higher price that Turbo Tax demands, but the convenience of avoiding careless mistakes, especially in math, make this software worth using.  If you also need to file a non-trivial state income tax form just be sure to buy a version that includes the state tax form.  I have no need for that though.  My state has no state income tax and my previous state had just simple modifications of what is on the 1040 to make that would not have justified paying even $1 more to get the state form.",0

He loved the interface.  He said it was scaled down and much more usable than Autocad, and that he thought this was a great alternative for people that did not know Autocad or that didn't want the expense of it or the PCs to run it on.

He had our house dimensions recorded, so we pulled those and quickly got a replica of our house done.  I've been having fun seeing the potential of our home with the Interior design features.  I love that you can import new objects from the big appliance and furniture makers!  The program already has a lot, but say, you want that nice new Maytag laundry set, you can go download it and see what it will look like in your home!

The garden design is something I think I simply LOVE.  If you have GPS, you can map the exact elevation of your lot!  There's an extensive plant database that lets you find plants for your region and place them in groupings.

It has flat views, 3-d Views, glass house views, and let's you import pictures of a lot to use as a background.  It let's you do bird's eye and walk-through and is VERY slick - I think it would be very impressive as a presentation tool for designers.

I'm actually delighted that this program doesn't cost MORE for what it does, and the fact that it has such high quality training with it.",0

"A First Look - Mac OS X 10.3 ""Panther""
Tim Robertson
Publisher/Owner, Columnist, MacRelevant
Friday, 10/24/03
As the masses await the Fed-Ex truck to deliver to their eager hands a copy of the latest Mac OS X release from Apple, Panther, MyMac.com presents our early, first-look at the eagerly awaiting OS.
First impressions: Wow, this thing is fast! Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther.
Expos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So what's the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. What's more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock.
To access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back.
If you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop.
Expos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac.
Heads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you ""Tab"" to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X.
Welcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them.
Many people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows.
One neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used ""Software Update"" in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it.
Fast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate ""Enable Fast User Switching"" in the ""Accounts"" pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a ""Basic"" in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named ""Kids"" which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.)
So what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I don't think enough people utilize.
All in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months.

"Love or hate it, I have always found Turbo Tax to be easy to use and covers everything I need for preparing my taxes.  Much cheaper than HRB.",0
Years ago I owed what I think was the first version of this product and it didn't work very well.  This product however works really well.  The menus are a bit confusing but as far as tracking goes this is a good product.  I  used it while on a trip along side my Magellean GPS and it compared well.  The PC version is a little slower than the standalone GPS but it is a nice alternative to buying a more expensive GPS.  Another pro is you have a bigger view of the map and can zoom in and out.,0

"I've been using H&R Block since they first started producing software to file from home and I still swear by it.  It's not only much easier than the rest, but one year it calculated a larger credit for me than a certain other popular program did.  Turns out the H&R Block calculation was the correct calculation, and I've been sold on it ever since.",0
"I can't imagine living without TurboTax to deal with our abomination of a tax system.  I don't know if it's accurate or not and don't care.  In March, I fire it up, enter a bunch of garbage, and click File.  Done, gone, over with for another year.",0

"This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase.",0
One of few that have 8 ports.  It was a great price.  It worked right away and got our system up in running in no time.,0

"I was looking for a way to connect multiple devices to my Yaesu FT-897 Amateur Radio. I had 3 devices that needed access to the 1 socket in the radio.

The price was much lower than the 2 port switch I had been considering, so I ordered it. Delivery was quite prompt and installing it to my station was easy. I'm very happy that I ran across it before ordering something less capable.",0
"Please note that I am by no means an authority on software of any variety. That being said, from the perspective of a layperson, this version of Trend Micro's security software appears to be doing a sufficient job protecting me and my computer from our respective selves. The first point to mention is that setup is extremely user friendly, even with regard to some of the specific software settings. At this point I have probably meddled with the configurations as much as I ever will, as I have only utilized this product on my home PC. Nonetheless, I have taken further steps customizing my security settings than I have ever done previously simply because of this software's ease of use and thorough, yet simple, explanation of available functions. One such customization option that I have now utilized for the first time on any security software is the parental control/web browser settings. The ability to restrict specific categories of information, images, and data, as well as descriptions of each category, allows one to feel confident in what they are blocking and what they are allowing on a user specific basis.

Beyond the actual customizable functions, almost everyone probably has the same question: will this security software slow everything on my computer to a screeching halt? After a little use, it seems that this particular software has not had the same ridiculous stopping power of other security platforms that I have utilized in the past. That is, as of this moment, I am pleased with my ability to utilize this software as the issuing company recommends while continuing the use of any other applications simultaneously. All in all, I am not disappointed and, perhaps, pleased (if such a thing is possible when dealing with PC/Internet security software).",0
I like it !! It has nice features like web administration and it works pretty well. Great Product for an awesome price.,0
"The only issue I have with this product is the price, but note that the price includes one year of free cloud storage.  WIth that, I'm not sure what happens after the year if you didn't have the items stored locally.  Still, the best thing for me with this product is that it will stream through Apple TV and Chromecast, thus allowing me to keep my rather bulky laptop in the my home office and not bring it in the living room with an hdmi cable.  Beyond that, and that's a big thing because I don't have a DVD player anymore (or Blu Ray, which this also covers), I'm not sure of the super value of this software.  So, it's loaded with features and all cool things, but just things (like superior sound) that just aren't super important to me.  Movies I get are usually comedies and don't need theater sound.  But, overall it's a very handy utility, with streaming and use with my iPhone, so I think the program does everything you'd want with something like this.  I wish it were cheaper, or, maybe there will be a 17th version at some point, dropping the price of this.  It still will be an amazing program.",0
"I am a complete newcomer to CAD and home design software, but I have always had the idea in my head that if I could draw my house on my computer, then I could see what interior design and exterior landscaping changes would look like prior to actually doing them.  So I was excited to have a chance to review Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 via Amazon Vine.

Make no mistake; this is serious home interior and exterior design (CAD) software, with loads of professional tools and features, and packed with thousands of items and choices to build your current home inside your computer, add a deck, or landscaping, or design your future dream home from the ground up.  But it's also incredibly fun, addictive, and (most of all) easy to use.  Even for someone like me, with no prior experience in home design software.

Before I started, I spent an hour or so watching the online tutorials to learn the basics. Next, I headed to my county's property appraisal website, found my lot in the city records, and printed out my exterior dimensions.  I opened a new floor plan, and quickly transferred those exterior dimensions to it.  Architectural 10 asks you to draw exterior walls in a clockwise direction, so it can add the siding on the outside.  You can adjust the thickness of these walls, and all the materials used.

Next came the fun (?) part; measuring all the rooms of my house and adding them to the floor plan.  After a few hours, I had a perfect 'dollhouse' model of my house (although I am still working on the tutorial about roofs!).  I added paint and flooring to match, and then the first room I started to decorate in was my kitchen.  I added cabinets, sink, fridge, dishwasher etc, all custom-altered to match my kitchen right down to the pulls on the drawers.  The program allows you to take any element and customize it however you like; not just furniture, but walls, roofs, wood framing, doors, windows--everything!  The result was a virtual replica of my kitchen, ready for resigning to my dream kitchen.

As you build up a floor plan in Architectural 10, you have numerous ways to view it.  Dollhouse is just that (like you've lifted off the roof and can see down into your rooms); Glasshouse (see-through walls), Frame (just the timber framing) etc etc.  If you want to look at something specific, you can place a camera in a static position, and pan round a room or hall or outside deck.  In addition, you can record a walk-through from a first person point of view, and share that with others.  My computer is three years old (although running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit and with a fairly recent graphics card), and I found all the views drew in incredibly fast, almost instantly.  I will list my computer specs at the end of this review.  The software runs great on my computer; I am also uploading a scan of the box back cover to show the recommended system specs.

Some cool features of Architectural 10 include the materials list.  You can budget for any house plan this way, adding the cost of items used in your design (flooring, windows, door handles etc), and then the program will generate a cost list based on the number of that item you use in your plan.  You'll know (practically down to the last nail) how much that dream house, or deck, or addition, will cost to build before you even start it.

Another cool feature is the ability to import a photo of your street to use as a background image.  If you just want to do some exterior landscaping, there's also an option of importing a photo of your house (front, back, side, etc) for use as the background, and then use the flower and tree menus to build your idea lawn and garden.  For the horticulturist, Architectural 10 even has a feature where you can age plants, so you can see exactly how tall that tree or shrub will be in ten years!

At this price point, Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 might scare away beginners and/or casual users, which is a pity because it really has a lot of professional tools and features wrapped up into an accessible package where experience is not necessarily needed to start designing and planning your next home or addition.

About the only negative thing I can think of to say about  Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 is that during installation process, it asks you to fill out your particulars, then PRINT AND MAIL a registration form!  Who does that in this day and age?  Couldn't it be via email at least?  Also, all the Library content (items, paint colors, floor coverings, plants etc etc) must be downloaded before you can use them, but you can do this all in one go, or as you want to use something (provided you are connected to the internet).

In closing, I will say that if you've ever wanted to try doing something like this and are okay with the price, then consider this software a great investment of your time and imagination . . . and then get out your tape measure!

"Other reviewers below have done A great job of listing all the features of the program so I will focus on my experience learning to use the PhotoDirector 5 Ultra.

I had never used a program like this before because I didn't cherish the idea of learning all the ends and outs of a program such as Photoshop. As I progressed in my photo taking abilities, I needed more than just the programs on my laptop or those that came with my Cannon Rebel EOS.

There was a learning curve for me and not quite as intuitive as others reviewed here. (Perhaps I should mention I'm 58 years old and new to a camera beyond a point and shoot.) However, I found the tutorials and handbook that came with the program to be quite helpful. Learning came much quicker once I found the these. Go to  [...]

Altogether it took about 20 minutes, it was a seamless process.  If you know that you want to install on several computers / laptops all at once you're good to go.  If not, you do have an option for later installation:  ""You can always install Sage 50 on additional computers later.""  I was simply installing in on my PC, so opted for the one for now.

One other thing you'll need to consider during installation is disabling your firewall.  I chose to allow my Windows Firewall to work with Sage, but I could also have configured it manually.  There are a few things to consider when installing, but I found it to be an easy step-by-step process with no problems.  I simply closed out everything in the background and concentrated on the installation process.

Sage 50 is perfect for the individual accountant or small business bookkeeper.  Customer support has been spotty in the past and that has been their biggest downfall.  This packet comes with a full year of customer support and online updates.  What I'm seeing and want to see, is easy access for when I need help.  There's online assistance where I can ""manage a case"" by shooting off an email or can access technical support via chat.  Personally I much prefer using phone support when I have issues (866-747-3888).  The proof is in the pudding as they say and if anyone is having issues, later reviews will probably let everyone know how customer support is doing.

Learning curves are sometimes what the individual makes of them.  I'm so far liking what I see.  I was able to take a look at a sample company and could easily spot a section ""Getting Around Sage 50.""  If I can't see anything right in a program or if I have to buy an expansive book I easily become frustrated and will turn away.  Sage has everything right where I want it ... at my fingertips right in the program.  More than likely, the lengthy installation had something to do with this.  I don't want to buy a ""secrets"" sort of book nor do I want to go scouting around on the net to find out something.

I was looking at ""Show-Me-How Videos,"" ""Quick Reference Guides,"" and a list of ""Sage University Courses.""  No further expenditure was needed on my part.  I didn't have to take a pill so to speak from getting a headache looking at a mess.  Everything was laid out nicely and wasn't overwhelming.  Many of the learning areas had drop down menus with additional areas to explore.  I'm going to list what I saw as an easy-access learning menu below.

Do I think I can easily manage and work with this accounting software?  Yes.  Am I confident the company will come through with that customer support that was lacking in the past?  I'm not sure, but that remains to be seen and can't be predicted without more people weighing in.

NEW USER OVERVIEW

Keep in mind that many of these topics have breakout drop down menus with additional help topics / information for the new user like me.",0
"Nancy's 11th outing takes her to a working ranch in Arizona, where she is to stay with her cousins' family. However, Nancy arrives at the airport to a less-than-warm welcome from a ranch hand, only to find that Ed Rawley was bitten by a rattlesnake and is in hospital.  As if that wasn't enough excitement, cousins Bess and George are stranded at the airport due to bad weather, so Nancy has to explore by herself.

A phantom horse has been sighted on the ranch just before bad things happen (broken pipes, downed power lines, rattlesnake bites),and it's up to teenage supersleuth Nancy to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding a historical romance that unfolded on the ranch between Frances Humber, daughter of the local sheriff, and outlaw Dirk Valentine.  Before he died, Dirk buried his treasure for Frances to find using a series of hidden clues, and the treasure remains somewhere on ranch property.  Besides Shadow Ranch, Nancy gets to explore a canyon full of petroglyphs, a Native American shop, a ghost town, and abandoned cave dwellings.

There are a number of suspects: Dave the ranch hand, Tex the head wrangler, Shorty the cook, and Mary Yazzie, a Native American jeweler. Nancy meets other characters over the phone, including a famous novelist, the local sheriff, and the Rawleys.

Several new features have been added, including a larger game window, which I liked, although navigating a full inventory could be confusing at times.  Nancy gets to learn about horses, barrel racing and how to use a lariat.  To get from place to place (there are six major locations), Nancy rides Bob the quarter horse.  Nancy can search for information on the web with her cell phone, which provides numerous hints as to how to solve puzzles. There is a strong educational element here, as Nancy sifts through information on not only ranch life (cattle branding, barrel racing, picking vegetables, feeding horses), but numerous other topics (knitting, agates, petroglyphs, flowers).

I liked the nature of the puzzles, although many reviewers complained about the repetitive chores, including daily egg collecting, vegetable picking, cake baking, and feeding the animals.  Nancy is expected to help out during her visit by performing tasks for various characters, including putting together a bridle, collecting eggs and vegetables, arranging a jewelry display, and collecting arrowheads.  There are a fair number of slider puzzles and several mazes. This game is more difficult than others in the series but not as hard as Secret of Blackmoor Manor.

Secret of Shadow Ranch had a very strong story, good character development, excellent music (Spanish guitar, country western, scary music in the ghost town that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck), improved graphics, well integrated puzzles, and a satisfying conclusion (which I didn't find in Secret of Blackmoor Manor).  Plenty of romance and suspense for young sleuths!",0
"I was extremely disappointed when I tried Toast 10.  I thought there would be some improvements, but it's just completely useless!
Of all the Toast versions, Toast 7 STILL gets the highest ratings on Amazon.  Here is why I still use it every time after all these years...

1.  Toast 10 just starts Exporting ALL THE SONGS (to fill up your hard drive with songs you don't want), and way too fast for good quality.  With Toast 7 you just: Insert a CD, drag it to the Toast window, and then CHOOSE THE SONGS you want to Export, and then choose High Quality.

2.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to Export from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are NO options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Exporting either.  With Toast 7 you can Export music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.

3.  Toast 7 makes perfect CDs every time.  I literally have NOT ended up with a ""coaster"" since about three computers ago, over 10 years ago.  I do use good blanks, but every blank I have tried has burned perfectly.

4.  With Toast 7 you can EASILY change the space between tracks from 0 to 8 seconds.  Zero seconds between tracks is essential for concept albums... Everything from Pink Floyd's the Wall to Disney's Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack, plus Classical Symphonies and Piano Concertos, and a few Tomita CDs, etc...

5.  Toast 7 still works perfectly with Snow Leopard 10.6.8 which is the BEST Mac OS ever... Snow Leopard is Lean and Powerful and able to run many older programs that the newer Mac Operating Systems cannot run. When I am required to install Mavericks to sync my new iPhone 5, I am going to partition a new hard drive to boot from both Snow Leopard AND Mavericks.  There's just too many things about Mavericks that are not cool, and too many things about Snow Leopard that are still essential!!

6.  Toast 7 worked perfectly on my iMac G5 running Tiger.  And it works perfectly on my 2008 Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.",0

"Rather than post a review right away, I decided to load up the program and run it awhile, seeing what kind of things it might find and whether I got more computer glitches.  Well, the program was easy to install.  It sits in the right hand tray and is easy to access.  I haven't found any incompatibilities with my other programs or computer function.  Doesn't seem to hog resources and scans my computer quickly.  So far, it only finds cookies to delete, but I'm a careful surfer and am careful about what I do on the web.  Running on Quad 8600 Gateway with 4 GB ram, NVIDIA BFG OC video card.  I especially like that it's two years of protection included.",0

"I was skeptical about using this at first because I already have AVG installed, but this tool works wonderfully in addition to my current protection software, with additional features, such as extended malware and virus protection. It scans all our internet sites and alerts you to possible problem areas, which is great, but it does this in addition to my current software, so I'm getting double the protection. The reports and scan area are easy to use, and the instructions are explicit, which I love. No guesswork involved here.
I highly recommend this item.",0

"I got the basic program set at a very good price.  When I loaded it over my Office 2003 it spared my Publisher.  MSO Basic 2007 does not include Publisher.

I wish I could use it to update my other computers, but that is not an option.  This set is for only one user - actually only one computer.

I find all the new innovations mind boggling.  Yet, the wisdom of most of the changes are apparent, and their are clearly additions that do not exist on earlier releases.

I am aware of other program suites that will satisfy most business users.  One is a free or open source office suite.  I'm just saying that Microsoft Office 2007 Basic is a really great suite of programs.  You must decide for yourselves what you want to spend and what will meet your needs.",0
You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the purchase of digital software does not go through the cart and are paid for one at a time.

So it did actually work :-),0

I tried Win 10 pro but after seeing all the data that was being sent to m/s from my computer I went back to this program win 7 pro,0
nice & simple works!,0
I really like this software.  It's very easy to use and very fast.  I recognize the need for keeping your hard drive clean for more efficient use and in the past have used several producst to do this.  WinCleaner allows me to do all that with just one product.  After you install it you can configure it to do what you want it to do.  From that point forward you just have to remember to click one button to run the software.  Works beautifully and keeps my 4 year hard drive running smoothly.,0

"I used to have Norton for years.  After all it was the industry standard, but after it let many a virus slip on through; I had enough.

I knew I would not get McAfee as I have repaired many computers with Mcaffee in the past (working in the computer field.)

So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings.  I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky.

Well two years later I have not looked back.  I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out.  They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc.  After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle.

When I had Norton, I would have to email them or be charged $40 for a phone call after their software let a virus in.  Talk about nerve.  No more, Trend Micro is head and shoulders above the rest!",0

absolulty easy to handle . the new's  features  compare to old video studio pro  made a video pro x4  more  freanly and easy to do a nice video show and some effects. recomended software.,0
"The Good:

*Doesn't hog your resources.
*Easily identifies unsafe websites.
*Great for novice and expert users alike.

The Bad:

*A more extensive user manual would've been nice.

The Bottom Line:

A great program that easily identifies unsafe websites.  You install it and forget it, as you will not hear a peep from this program, as if it wasn't there.  You can see the results just by going to Google.  It uses a simple green, yellow and red system to identify the website.  As you hover over a link, it will give you a more extensive review of the website.  I'm an avid surfer and even I was amazed how some of the website I used to think are safe are not necessarily safe.  This is even a great tool for parents to educate their kids about net safety by explaining to them not to click on anything that McAfee marks as a suspect.  Overall, McAfee Site Advisor Plus is a great addition to any PC.",0

"I'd heard Norton 2009 was a dramatic improvement over previous editions and, since Zone Alarm still won't work with my 64-bit Vista, I canceled my Zone Alarm purchase and got Norton Internet Security for the three computers in my house.  Just out of curiosity I find myself checking it from time to time just to be sure it's working.  It is, of course.  It's just much more unobtrusive than any security suite I've ever used before.  So far I'm very enthusiastic.  And since I've also heard the telephone help has been improved, it feels like I'm going to get very comfortable using Norton exclusively for all my computers.",0

nice to check you accountants math.,0
"I have been using WordPerfect since 1983. Although I use Microsoft Word at times, WordPerfect is still my word processor of choice. My primary reason for preferring WP over Word is that it is much easier to format documents and to fix stuff when it goes wrong.

I absolutely LOVE reveal codes. Nothing Word can do can make up for not having reveal codes. You can instantly see your settings and easily adjust any formatting.

The main reason to use Word is because everyone else uses it. The main reason to use WordPerfect is that it is the best word processor out there.

A few notes on WPX7:

I installed it on a Win7 laptop. It took about five minutes to run the installation. I only  installed WP and Lightning, not the spreadsheet and presentation programs, so it would take longer if you installed all of them. Everything worked immediately--no problems, no crashes, nothing.

The installation program will ask if you want to move settings from a previous WP installation to the new version and if you want to delete the old installation. It makes life easy when you upgrade.

The programs may be installed on up to three PCs.

The Home & Student version is a stripped-down version. It does not include a few features found in the Standard and Professional versions, such as the ability to edit PDFs, ebook creation software and disk burning software. It also does not include the Paradox database program that is only available in the Pro version.

I have been a huge WP fan for years, and this new version will keep our relationship going for a long time to come.",0
Works perfectly,0
"I've used this product for many years.  It's not the cheapest tax preparation software around, but I've found it about the best, and far cheaper than having it done professionally.",0
"I'm very pleased with the size and quality of the product.  It's tiny, with just enough of the unit exposed so that it can be easily grasped and removed.  It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

I'm really glad that I bought it based both on the performance & the fact that it was a third of the cost of similar items sold in local stores.",0
I have held off from writing this review so that I could be absolutely sure that Trend Micro Titanium is the software for me and my little computing center.  It is.  I have used it several months now and no matter what I throw at it it keeps me secure and I could not ask for more protection.  The one element about Trend that I like above all is that is works pretty much in the background and does not slow my processor that much.  All security programs will slow the processor some and some create quite a burden on the temper of the user.  Its footprint is small and its abilities are significant.  Of the several packages that I have used I like this one best.,0
Bad,1
I've been a user of Kaspersky for several years on 3 different computers and continue to enjoy having it protect my computers.  I used another Antivirus/Security program for several years before that but found that it placed files all over the computer and in one case interfered with my loading a program.  I got error messages until I removed all remnants of the old virus program in the registry and other places on the hard drive.  I finally got the program to load.  Kaspersky has given me absolutely no problems whatsoever.,0

"VERMONTERS DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE.  Tax Software is suppose to help you complete your taxes accurately.  How can you complete your taxes when they don't have all the forms you need?

This is a basic form that all Vermonters should file if they owner their home and claim Vermont as their primary residence.  I recommend Turbo Tax or Tax Hawk, I have used both in the past and both have the proper forms to declare a homestead.  One star is too good a rating for this software.",1
Very complete program for managing personal finances. It is one of only several programs I would not be without. It is handy for looking up purchase dates of various items.

to install Art Disc and Art Disc 2 individually.  Then it works as well as the program on Windows 8.1.

"Cyberlink PowerDirector 11 is a fun, intuitive, and easy to learn video editing program.  It is highly stable and not susceptible to crashes like some other consumer level video editing software titles.  It offers a full feature set that allow the novice to grown and take on more and more advanced projects.  You have unlimited sound and video tracks to add to your project, as well as popular green screen and PIP options.  It offers everything from full control over you creations to wizards that can create a movie or slide show for you after you select what assets you'd like included.  It accepts a wide range of video codecs and has a good library of effects and music to use as well as multiple output options.  You can burn your own DVDs with templates and menus, output to your computer or portable device, or directly upload to the leading social networking and video sharing websites. I really can't say enough good about this program, I love it.  While Pinnacle Studio used to be my favorite editor for short projects, but now PowerDirector is my program of choice for such things.  You can expand your library of effects, transitions, and music from leading content providing sites like Smart Sound and New Blue FX.  In my opinion, when it comes to effects though, less is more if you want to create a straight forward and attractive presentation.  It is one of the only video editing programs that offers a full printed manual as well as online tutorials and ample in application help.  If you are new to video editing, or a more experienced editor who just wants to get back to basics I highly reccomend this program.

For those wanting to experiment with 3D, PowerDirector 11 can edit footage from your 3D video camera or allow you to convert 2D footage to 3D Anaglyph productions.  This is a good option for the novice who does not have all the expensive 3D peripherals and wants to share 3D films with family or friends.  A pair of anaglph glasses are included and inexpensive cardboard ones are available for purchas online as well as slightly more expensive ones made out of plastic.  If you want to share, I'd reccomend buying the cardboard ones and sending them to your intended audience or have them on hand to show your 3D films on your regular TV set--no 3D TV set required.",0

Used on computers using XP and Vista. No problems creating PDF's so far. It's basic and creates a PDF just as good as ADOBE's overpriced version. I recommend this product.,0
"I got this product for a netbook that later died, but I owned it long enough to know I wish I had not sent it off with the netbook that needed repairs. This product (I bought it in April of 2010, while it still was the non-SP1 version) was an answer to prayer because it removed all the OEM bloatware-bloating from a netbook running Windows 7 Starter, and it's transferrable should the netbook die but you hold onto the software.

Windows 8 doesn't seem magical or revolutionary to me, and the iPad lost it's magical and revolutionary feeling when I had to either upgrade it or give up on the whole idea. So that brought me back to Windows 7, and even though I lost my copy of Windows 7 of this product type, it was worth every penny and I don't know how much more.

I am most likely going to buy another one to replace the one I lost, because this operating system is (to this humble reviewer) the as perfect as possible version of Vista, which while I sympathize with those who spent heavily on the Vista idea only to have them fix and replace it for nearly the same price, I can honestly say that I had no hardware that could run Vista until late 2008,whereas with Windows 7's lighter touch I had three systems from the get-go that could run that OS choice.

If you have a multitude of PCs and can get it legal, I would recommend the Family Pack, but if you can't, I recommend this product as a backup option, even if you have to buy 5 or 6 copies of it.

This is simply something that will most likely never come again. Grab it while you can.

Update 1/15/2013: I did indeed buy another copy of it, this one with SP1 from the get go, and counting my Windows 7 Home Premium Famuly Pack Upgrade, I can now have Windows 7 on up to 7 PCs of the 2007 to 2011 stripes, and life is great for me. I know this is expensive, but Windows 7 makes your computer life easier compared to Windows 8, unless of course you love Windows 8-in which case I don't want to deny you your choice.

I just know that I can have 7 computers all on one HomeGroup, have a Start menu that isn't a world unto itself, have a browser that isn't broken by a feature Microsoft intended to make up for the increasing Orwelliam aspects of Windows 8 but that websites don't want to work with because the ads that make the Internet free depend on that feature being unavailable or at worst ineffective. Google ""Do Not Track in Internet Explorer 10"" to find out more.

Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:

I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.

I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.

I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.

Update 1/22/2013:

Here it is, 3 years and 3 months exactly to the day that Windows 7 was released, and since I didn't want to experience the stress of putting an old MacBook from 2007 through Vista (but I DID own a legal copy of it, which covers my you-know-what if Microsoft later tries to say I upgraded illegally) I did the install Windows 7, play around in it, erase the hard disk, reinstall Windows 7, and it activated perfectly. Of course, since I was doing the clean install thing, I had to re-import my programs, files, and settings from other computers on my HomeGroup, but I have done all that and it went smooth as silk.

Unlike with Windows 8, I do not feel like I wasted my money on any of my 7 copies of Windows 7, regardless of the limitations Home Premium may have compared to Professional or Ultimate. (Of course it helps when 3 PCs were upgraded using the Windows 7 Family Pack, but that is something else entirely.

As to the disappointment some people voiced in libraries versus a concrete storage location, I think that you should have the libraries but have all the folders in a library be physically anchored within the library structure so that files are not being copied from mysterious library locations but instead are being copied from whatever physical folder is the part of the library from which the file you eant to copy to the destination PC is located in.

Update 2-3-2014:

Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.

Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.

For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.

Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):

Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:

I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!

I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?

I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!

I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.

"Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security has become my favorite for my Windows PCs over the past two years.  So much so that I recommended it to my step-father, knowing that I'd be the one installing it on his PCs after he made the purchase on Amazon.

INSTALLATION:

Download went smoothly (as expected) and then it was time to install the software on (5) Windows PCs running XP, Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8 and two running 8.1 as an operating system.  All of the installs went off without a hitch and Webroot SecureAnywhere  is running quietly in the background.

FIRST SCANS:

On the XP PC the first scan snagged several virus'.  This PC had formerly been using AVG Free.

On the Windows 8 PC it had been using AVAST Free, and the first scan with Webroot found a virus.

On the two Windows 8.1 PCs which both had trial versions; one of Norton and one of Kaspersky, no virus' were found upon the initial scan with Webroot.

On the Windows 7 PC no virus' were found.  It had been using Webroot SecureAnywhere 2013; subscription had just run out.

"I have reviewed PowerDirector 11 here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPLA2VIBROCG/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm, so I won't go into much detail other than the new features.  I installed this version 12 on a new Windows 8 All-in-one.  It installed relatively quickly and without a problem.

One of the new features in this version is Multicam Designer, which makes it easier to put together video using multiple cameras.  You can synchronize the audio with the different camera angles, and while looking at all of videos at the same time, cut between different angles as you put together the video.  Cool!  I don't have multiple video cameras, but I can imagine you would want one that can capture excellent audio (or use a separate audio recorder), and the rest of the cameras can be video-only as long as they all shoot in the same quality/framerate/size/etc.  I would like to try this out sometime -- this is a step toward more professional video production.

There is also a new Theme Designer that will help you create nice compilations of photos and videos.  Just drag and drop them into a template and it will create a finished video for you.

They also finally included an auto-crossfade feature, where if you overlay two tracks, it will allow you to insert a crossfade from one to the other.  This was a feature from Corel VideoStudio that I missed in PowerDirector.

This version utilizes the 64-bit environment of Windows 7 and 8 better than the previous version, with quicker rendering.  I have not had any crashes yet with v12, but keep your copy up to date since Cyberlink seems to like sending out new versions before all the bugs have been discovered and worked out.

So overall, I think this software is one of the best for consumer video editing -- a step up from MovieMaker and other free software, but of course not as intense as Sony Vegas Pro or Adobe Premier Pro.  With this one, you can get a quick slide show together with music, or a simple home video edited with intro and titles, all with a 'wizard' that makes it easy - then post to YouTube or create a DVD with menus all in the program.  Or you can dabble in some editing and now even multi-camera shooting if you are an enthusiast or want to take the next step into better quality video production.

I have some other reviews on other consumer-grade video editors here, if you'd like some comparisons:

"this has magic wand and magic wand is worth the upgrade from any previous version of PSP.
it also has custom color palettes, complimentary colors and color gradients that make edits nice.",0
"I really like this software program; it's easy and straightforward.  I was able to use the program right out of the box instead of having to read and learn how to use it from a manual.
After installing PC Tools and Internet Security 2009 v6.0 I ran it and found many bugs that Adaware missed.  Also, the program ran very fast--faster than many other programs that I have tried and it was even more thorough.
I completely recommed this program.",0
"Unlike some reviewers I had no problems installing or running any part on Windows 7 64bit. Everything worked well and was very easy to follow and fill in. I completed every document as well as the Living Will without a hitch. Yes, you can only have access to the Living Will for two years and make changes for only one year, but considering the cost of this entire package, compared to a lawyer's fees, how can anyone complain! I have no reluctance to recommend this download since it was super easy and worked flawlessly for me. It takes many hours to complete but one can return to work on it many times. I completed and printed all documents over a two week period with a couple of hours per session.",0
Much better than 2011 version,0
"I have been using this for over a month. It is very fast and starts up quickly, and screen is especially pleasing to the eye.",0
"I purchased this program for my new Vista PC and I was quite pleased with the new and improved features, which integrates quite well on a Vista PC. As a previous owner of Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002, I have become reliant on the program for both work and home. I elected to buy Outlook and Office Student and Home to maximize my dollar towards my Office purchase and I have no regrets. The Office Standard edition does not include One Note, which is one of those programs that integrates well with the new Outlook. In the end, I spent less and got more.

I would not recommend (nor do I intend) to upgrade my Office 2003 for my XP notebook. Likewise, I would not recommend purchasing Outlook without a complementary Office edition. If you have a new PC with Vista, it's a good idea to use Office 2007 in whatever fashion is most economical for your needs. If you don't use Office, there are tons of great e-mail programs that are available at no charge and an Outlook stand-alone purchase makes little sense. I think Thunderbird/Firefox is a sound choice for the non-Office user.",0
Satisfied by this product. 5/5,0
"Incredibly versatile, MapPoint 2010 is packed with mapping functionality and the options are plentiful.

Once you begin to explore MapPoint's features, you will quickly realize its potential benefits for either recreational travel or business. It is a powerful piece of software.

The pushpins have been updated to include many more symbols to choose from.

The ""Measure Distance"" tool allows you to trace along routes with instant feedback so you may find out if it really is ""shorter to go that way.""

Planned routes can be searched for places or points of interests along the way within specified distances, and MapPoint will display an easy-to-follow proximity-highlighted readout of the results complete with extended information. You can easily expand or contract the distance criterea as well.

Under the Map Settings tab, you can selectively add or remove symbols, labels or both from various types of featured map points making custom views extremely simple.

There are so many possibilites with MapPoint 2010, and it is a much more powerful program than Streets and Trips. Powerful Data Mapping features allow you to do business-related analysis visually. If you are interested only in finding your way around, it would be more cost-efficient to go the Streets and Trips route...otherwise this is a remarkable package - I love MapPoint 2010!",0
Years ago I owed what I think was the first version of this product and it didn't work very well.  This product however works really well.  The menus are a bit confusing but as far as tracking goes this is a good product.  I  used it while on a trip along side my Magellean GPS and it compared well.  The PC version is a little slower than the standalone GPS but it is a nice alternative to buying a more expensive GPS.  Another pro is you have a bigger view of the map and can zoom in and out.,0
"I recently was running Trend Micro on my computer and when the subscription expired I wanted to try a new Anti-Virus software, because Trend Micro was really slowing my computer down. So after reviewing tons of Anti-Virus software , I bought Kaspersky. Now the installation is pretty easy but, if you get stuck, just go to their support center and they will help you with any problems. So after I installed the software it had to do an update and restart, but after that you are ready to go! Now compared to Trend Micro, this program flies! My web pages load instantly, my programs load faster, and pretty much a completely faster system. Now the best feature this software has I think is where it will adjust how much RAM it uses, based on what you are doing. So say that you are trying to load a youtube video and you want all your power to go to that, Kaspersky will automatically adjust how much RAM it is using, to let you watch your movie and then will boost back up when your computer is idle. My son loves it because it is perfect for playing games, especially those high end graphics games that all the kids love. He has noticed a big difference in the speed that the computer manifests now as opposed to running Trend Micro.

It does EVERYTHING that Trend Micro did (& more) , but better! :-) We are pleased!

It is definitely a better value!",0
"I have a child with autism who is developmentally delayed in many areas. He has come very far and is now a great reader, though I had wished I had something like this for him years ago. I tried many reading programs, including Hooked on Phonics and those learning websites like Reading Eggs and ABC Mouse, but none really got him motivated enough to make a big difference. Now with my 5-year-old that just started kindergarten, I am hoping to get off to an early start and put this to use with her. I love that it works on iPad because every child I know is very familiar with them and knows how to operate them with ease. Not so much with a computer. Typing and using a mouse was a big obstacle, not to mention having to sit at a desk, especially for a child that can't sit still for very long. Being able to do all this on a portable iPad is worth it's weight in gold.

I've previewed the program before starting out with the kids, and I love what I see. Everything is very animated and colorful and it makes the entire process truly entertaining. The little ""Lingos"" are very cute and add a lot to the lessons. The way the skills transition is also very smooth and well thought out. It starts with the basics, names of letters and letter sounds, and then starts building from there, putting sounds together two at a time, and eventually putting them into full words. I've always been a fan of LeapFrog products for learning to read, but since most households have an iPad of some sort these days, I'd say it's worth it to purchase this for your existing tech over going out and buying a children's tablet and it's associated software which will easily cost much more in the long term than just buying this set.

Overall, I think it's a fantastic value and should be on every parent's list for little ones about to start school or just starting as well as for those who are struggling. It will give them a huge leg up. With public school curriculum getting more and more challenging all the time, kids are expected to be reading fluently in first grade and there's not much opportunity for catch up as the reading skill is required for all other subjects. The packaging is adorable too, with a cute little ribbon handle, so it would make a really nice gift for any child. Great product all around.",0
"I bought this router knowing that it was an old model, I needed an access point to set up a wireless home network for my nephews on my mom's home.
It was a pleasant surprise how good the Linksys router worked not only for the easy setup to the cable modem but also for the quality of the signal, with high stability and a wider range than the router I replaced.",0
This product is an excellent - low cost for great product.  We have used it many times on numerous jobs & recommend it highly.,0
"It only took about five minutes to install, and it works like a charm, just like the last 5+ years I have been using TurboTax.  THANK GOODNESS!!  I held my breath the whole time, scared to death it was going to flop. I am still wondering why so many other folks are having problems. So sorry for them ~ I wish I was more computer-literate and able to discuss that side of it.

Upon reading all those other troubled reviews, I was just about convinced I needed a new computer, just to do my taxes! I guess come April/May I will 'for real' when the support for XP goes away, but for now, I am happy with my old fashioned XP and my smoothly operating TTS (trusty tax software!)

I started not to get TurboTax this year, based on all those negative reviews, but thanks to 'gut instinct', all is good.

Oh, for the Software itself, yeah the Important part of the review, I really can't say much ... I hate math and I hate doing taxes.  That's why I choose TurboTax ... They do it all for me :)  Even though our taxes are really pretty simple/straightforward, all I have to do is fill in the blanks. Easy-peasy overall, free e-file and the State form is what does it for me.  What more could a girl want ??

"This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase.",0
"I have been using this product since its early releases (purchased this version as an upgrade through Acronis). This backup software got me out of trouble a few times including one incident which my PC's hard drive completely crashed. I was able to recover all my backup data and got my computer going again within 1-2 days. It took about 4 hours on the average to backup 250 Gbytes of data with the verify option turned on.

I also used this software to expand my laptop hard drive capacity using the cloning feature. So far I have cloned three of my laptops' hard drives to the higher capacity 500 GB drives without any problems. It is quite useful particularly with the low hard disk drives cost nowadays.

Another beauty of this backup software is that it allows you to browse the contents of the  backup file with a windows explorer like interface and selectively restore the files without have to manually launch the recovery option from the menu. If you register this software on the Acronis product website, you would also be able to download the latest updates of the same version (fully installable file, not patches) for free by logging in your account.",0
"If you're engaged in just about any sort of business today, it's difficult not to have Microsoft office. Sooner or later, a colleague will send you a spreadsheet with some sort of custom macro that only works in Excel, or a presentation that only seems to render properly in authentic PowerPoint. Even if you're a diehard Mac user with all sorts of sophisticated alternate apps on your Mac, sooner or later you'll wish you had Microsoft Office.

The good news is that Microsoft has made it really easy to get Office, and to share both the apps and your documents across a wide range of devices, not just your Mac. On my iPad, for example, I use Office 365...gone are the days of saving presentations as PDFs so that I can display them from my iPad since the built-in PPT viewer doesn't quite display complex slides correctly. Create the PPT on my Mac, save it in One Drive (or even Dropbox), and there it is on all my devices at the same time.

There are lots of choices about how to get Office. This product - the key card - is somewhat more traditional...you download the software and install it using the serial number on your key. It's a big download, but if you have a fast Internet connection, the whole thing only takes a few minutes.  If you use Office on multiple devices, you might want to compare the key card approach to an Office 365 subscription...in my case, I have two mobile devices, three Macs and a Windows computer - one license of Office 365 covers all that, plus ongoing upgrades, way less expensively than buying individual keys for each system.

However you get it, Office 2016 is definitely the best Office yet, but it has no huge surprises in terms of functionality. The overall look is fresh and updated, but still familiar to anyone who has used Office in the past. The apps are large and can be slow on older, marginal computers, but they tend to run really well on the latest hardware. If you're a guru at using obscure Word features, you'll find that they all work pretty much the same way, and documents you created years ago still view and print correctly. I always had minor formatting and usage issues with the prior Mac version - so far, everything I've tried seems to work better in Office 2016, and that alone is probably a good enough reason to upgrade.",0
"I know little about computers. I wanted to be able to use the desktop without having to have our wireless router on all the time. Ordered this, at first it scared me that there was really no instructions. I plugged in the Cat5 from the cable box, ran one cat 5 to desktop, one to wireless router, turned it all back on, and everything works!!! If it's easy enough that I can do it, anyone can. <G>",0
"My employer just upgraded to this and it's absolutely awful, I'm going to have to see if I can convince IT to let me go back to Office 2010. I didn't like the ribbon interface when it came out and after all these years I still find it cumbersome but at least it doesn't make my eyes hurt. Office 2013 is full of glaring white space wasting huge amounts of screen space. There is practically no contrast anywhere and it just looks like a sea of text on a drab white background. Has Microsoft lost their mind? I've seen better UI designs on beta software and open source junk from 15 years ago.",1
Will use again vs. Turbo Tax given terrible policies on pricing and overall customer service attitude of Intuit.,0
"Works well on my 64-bit Windows 7 Pro machine. Installation was a breeze, and it has no problems connecting to my router in another room. The software it comes with seems streamlined and intuitive, with no excessive bloat.",0

Kaspersky is a good product but I now use Windows Defender which is also very good.,0
"I installed this scanner on my 6 month old Dell laptop running Windows XP Pro. The installation was quick and easy, and it integrated automatically into Microsoft Office.

The first document I scanned was a two-page contract. In 20 seconds, I had a PDF version on my computer that I could email to the customer. This alone is worth the price of the product: not having to drive back to the office to use the scanner to make electronic copies of signed contracts.

Next I tried some business cards. The scanner quickly delivered full-color scans. I'm looking forward to trying the OCR feature for database import.

The scanner comes with a felt bag to carry it safely in a briefcase. This is a nice touch that makes it an ideal mobile solution. There's only one cable-power is delivered over the USB connection.

This scanner is one more reason that I DON'T have to run back to the office. I'm really happy with it. I gave it five stars because it completely and elegantly solves the problem I had-scanning on the road. And by the way, it looks great.",0
"I have windows vista Home Premium  and I tryed four diferent antivirus from diferent companies and no one works well I have programs conflicts and lot of errors on my Laptop, and then I bought Norton 360 and work Wonderful, this norton really protects your computer and detected malicious internet pages is a good security for my lap and my privacy.

I was so happy with this, and my updated version caught some bugs right away. In the past I've had Viper, Kapersky, Norton, and a few others. I think Norton has greatly improved (remember the days when every 2 minutes Norton would pop up begging you to upgrade?), but I seem to be doing best with McAfee products.",0
"I have use Quicken for over 15 years and I can't believe how cumbersome and poorly conceived this version is compared to past versions.  The main page is useless and you now have to open multiple windows to get the information you need, then you have to close all the windows you opened to get to the next account.  When looking at a performance page of your investment accounts you get a pie chart instead of a bar graph.  What good is a pie chart when you are looking at performance data over a specific time range.  I thought the purpose of newer versions was to improve the existing version and not regress.  If Microsoft still had a financial program I would be forced to migrate to another program.  Intuit needs to change it's company name because this program is not intuitive.  It is ill conceived and makes for a frustrating experience.",1
"I received Quick books Pro 2011 for review from the Amazon Vine program. Here's my take on it:

I run a jewelry design business and had been using an old version of Quicken to track inventory for tax purposes. I'd heard good things about Quick books and decided to investigate it for my home business application.

Installation was super easy. The more difficult part was learning how to make the options work for me. This is a robust program that tracks much more than inventory, also allow check writing, bookkeeping and much more. Some users take classes just to understand how to use the program effectively. I didn't avail myself of that opportunity since I was only interested in the inventory tracking portion.

The initial setup was more complicated than Quicken but allows many more options. Itemizations such as Vendor Options include Purchase Orders, the ability to receive inventory with or without invoices, enter bills against inventory and more. There's a Customer section where one can create invoices, sales receipts, refunds and credits and receive payments. Under Company one can chart accounts, items and services, and a variety of inventory related activities. Finally a Banking section lets you write checks, reconcile accounts, print checks and record deposits-in short, everything a business, large or small needs to track.

For inventory tracking, once you input a vendor and select a category (many from which to choose that include supplies, office, postage and more), it is possible to list each item bought and track stock quantities, and this was accomplished with only a quick perusal of the tutorial. I like that you can manage customer, vendor, and employee data in one place easily, with quick access to related transactions. Reports can be created instantly, but one of the items most appealing to me is that you can pick up new skills at your own pace with the built-in Learning Center. This means that starting at a basic level as I have doesn't mean that I can become more proficient as I become accustomed to the many facets of this powerful, yet easy-to-use program.

Some reviewers have complained about pop-ups that advertise extra services. A response from Intuit tells how to turn off these annoying ads.

Since I am a one-person business and don't plan to do actual banking with Quick books, the software is perfect for my needs.",0

"Poser 9 is such an engaging and fun interface to work with. I am thrilled with this latest release. The presentation is gorgeous; the entire workspace is brilliantly refined.

The well-balanced user interface provides efficient navigation. As always, numerous interface tweaks may be applied and saved to easily accessible memory dots, and when combined with presets of common 3D workflow layouts, it makes preparing for and alternating between tasks almost effortless.

The new features and the core rendering enhancements are quite significant and they target not only the desires of the casual user but also the needs of the most dedicated artists and illustrators. Accessibility defines Poser 9! Vertex weight maps, subsurface scattering, tablet support for the morph tool, Python 2.7, faster hair and (thankfully) framing a selected objet with a toggle to rotate around the selected object describes some of the most welcome, but not the only, additions and enhancements to the software.

I love Poser 9! When I take into account how much I enjoy using it compared to previous versions, I can officially rank it as a heavy hitter as far as quality products go. It is worth the upgrade regardless of which version one comes from, and it is definitely worth the investment for curious new users who can pretty much just install it and take over the creative reins immediately.

It's clear to see the efforts made by the development team in order to make this such an incredible tool.",0
"The Crime: A -

Bess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch. Now a phantom horse is appearing at night, heralding major accidents. Just before Nancy arrives, for example, Bess's uncle is bit by a rattlesnake and rushed to the hospital. What's going on here?

Suspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.

Fun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.

By this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.

The story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though. Plus there are horses. Horses count for a lot in my book.

Puzzles: A -

Puzzles included everything from baking a cake to solving a little metal maze. The maze drove me insane.

One puzzle in particular made me roll my eyes because the way you find the solution is utterly dumb. You're looking for a really old piece of information, and Bess and George, stuck at the airport, happen to find a book that contains exactly what you need to know. And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.

Gameplay: A +

The new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access. I thought the wide screen was great but the extra clicking irritated me, because if you may miss the little button to close it or change pages. You get used to it, though.

Western life comes alive at Shadow Ranch, where you repair the chicken coop, perform daily tasks and always take care of your horse when you get back to the stable or Tex will have something to say to you!

Other fun in the game includes invesitgating a ghost town, learning to use a lariat (lasso) and completing a barrel race in under ten seconds.

You know how I said that DDI has everything but romance? Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.

Time Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.

Voice Acting: A

Raspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend. Many of the voice actors hear have appeared in other games, so it's a treat for a long-time fan. Superlative delivery, as always.

Favorites -

""My anti-persperant's going to get a workout today!"" Nancy

""Ma'am."" Dave

Any compliment Dirk Valentine gives Frances

Music: A +

Country-western heaven. (Except for Shorty's yodeling.) You could almost feel the heat.

IGraphics/Video: A +

Getting better and better all the time. Bonus points for the animated sequences such as gallop of the phantom horse.

Technical: A

No problems, just peachy.

Overall,

If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. A Must-have.",0

"Everyone doing drafting today is familiar with AutoCAD. It is so widely used that there are now several alternate use models for which AutoCAD itself is overkill. AutoCAD LT 2012 perfectly fits several of these, take a look:

Home/Laptop/Travel/Sales Office/Customer Meetings: I keep a copy of LT on my laptop for use at customer meetings and even the work site.  Cheaper than AutoCAD, with perfect compatibility. There's no better way to review and modify drawings in the field (except AutoCAD). I know of one contractor who keeps a laptop loaded with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-LT-2010/dp/B001UO8M8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD LT 2010</a>&nbsp;on loan with his biggest customer. They can view anything, make changes, and in general work together better.

2D Drafting: AutoCAD LT 2012 is all you need. There is nothing a 2D draftsman needs that this package does not offer. Note however, none of AutoCAD's 3D capabilities are included.

As successful as this low-end product has become, it has one flaw: it retains the steep learning curve of its big brother. I am of two minds here. As a powerful stand-alone 2D package, AutoCAD LT 2012 has a depth of capability that few will use completely. That depth deserves some learning (or better yet, professional training). Makers of other high end packages have successfully built low-end tools that are easier to learn: Adobe Photoshop Elements comes to mind. But Elements provides only a small subset of the functionality of Photoshop, unlike AutoCAD LT 2012, which provides virtually the entire AutoCAD feature set (except 3D).

So if you need a 2D drafting package with flawless AutoCAD compatibility, AutoCAD LT 2012 is literally perfect. But if you don't use AutoCAD already, you will need training, or at the very least a good book!",0
"I refused to use a walkthrough for this game. Absolutely refused. And players, I promise you don't need one. You just really have to put your noggins to work. Which I can understand why some people don't like that (who loves thinking? pah! -- I kid, I promise). I just really (REALLY) enjoy brain teasers and puzzles. I always have. My mother got me two huge books full of puzzles as a kid and I finished them within a month. That being said, if you like your games more straight forward, you probably won't enjoy this game as much. But that's ok too, there's a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.

My one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.

But really, they're minor complaints. This game is rich in history, both fictional and some real, the spooky air is well maintained, and the mystery goes perfectly with the adventure. I felt a bit intrusive on the family, but that's a good thing. It makes Nancy as a character stronger. She is nosy to a fault. And I thank the creator for that because that creates amazing games.

If you're ready to take a challenge and be scared a bit, then you're ready for this game. But if you're looking for something a bit easier to complete, I suggest picking up Treasure in a Royal Tower instead. It isn't scary by any means, but other than that it has a lot of the same things this game does. Rich history and a lot of exploring. If you're looking for an easier scary game...well, they haven't actually produced an easy scary game yet (and I don't think Haunted Mansion/Ghost Dogs count as scary, Malloy is a meh game and I don't recommend it to anyone, and Shadow at Water's Edge, while being pretty scary, is also a bit on the hard side).",0

"I am a long time user of Photoshop Lightroom, from the first version. I used to use Photoshop to manage and edit digital images, but switched to LR totally from then. LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.

Well, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.

If you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video. But if you want more like publishing, converting and optimizing images, I recommend this training video.",0

"Vista is indeed a revolutionary OS. The user interface was a MAJOR improvement over XP. The Game Explorer is a very nice addition for gamers. And best of all, it doesn't crash! It's just stable.

I have used Vista Business since its release in January 2007 and it has been absolutely rock solid. It's fast (faster than XP even on systems with more than 4Gbs of RAM), much more secure than XP, compatible with older software, sexy Aero effects, and boasts loads of new features and improvements. And I already mentioned the much improved interface.

Yes, it does have a few bad things. UAC is one of them, but that can be easily turned off. Slow file transfer over the network was indeed a problem early on, but was fixed even before SP1 came out. And DRM is still just as bad as in XP.

Windows 7 is coming out in a few months, but it's not out now, so Vista still holds the crown as the best Windows version out there. Actually, Windows 7 is nothing but Vista SE with a new name. I ran the Windows 7 release candidate full time for a month, and realized that I had been running ""Windows 7"" since January 2007. Heh. I will still upgrade to Win7 though, if I find it for cheap (the current upgrade prices are NOT worth it if you already own Vista).

Overall, this OS has served me well over these past three years, and just felt compelled to write a positive review. Good job Microsoft! :)",0
"This antenna is great.  I set it up at my house and it provides a good signal all the way to my guest house, which is 250ft away at least and with 5 walls between the computer and the router.

"I have used several different spyware removal tools; before Spy Sweeper my favorite was Ad-Aware by Lavasoft. While I still use Ad-Aware, I depend on Spy Sweeper for the heavy duty work of removing spyware that is tough to ferret out. I generally run all the anti-virus and spyware detection tools installed on my computer (after updating the definitions, of course) and then run Spy Sweeper. I am always amazed at what Spy Sweeper finds left over after the others say my machine is clean.

This program is very comprehensive, and is updated very frequently. It is easy to use and features generally easy to grasp deletion options (much easier than most competitors.) Even a PC novice can use this program successfully.

I have found Spy Sweeper to be robust and to consistently catch more spyware traces than any other product, though I believe it's wise to use multiple products for the best possible protection.

I highly recommend Spy Sweeper. I can't imagine owning a computer and not having this installed on it. It is, by far, my preferred anti-spyware solution.",0
Turbo Tax has always been easy software to use to do my own taxes. This years version was easy to use. I was able to do my taxes in about 45 minutes and my roommate's taxes in about 20 minutes.

I also like that Turbo Tax is available for both MS Windows and Mac OS X.,0

Norton Security Deluxe 5 Devices does what its suppose to do. Hope Norton stays on top of the game. Best place to buy is here.,0
"I started using CorelDRAW on a Mac 512, back in the late '80s, as an improvement over MacDraw.  As the years went by, the reality is that most of the world is on PCs, not Macs.  I wasn't doing enough graphics work to justify a good package, so I made a lot of graphics with Visio, PowerPoint, or (eeeek!) ""Paint"".  Finally, I moved up to Adobe PhotoShop -- What a headache!!!  It took a week's worth of classes to learn how to use the daggone thing!

Remembering how much better CorelDRAW was on the old Macs, I was eager to try this -- and I am NOT disappointed!  I have been using the PhotoPaint part of this package a lot, and it is - relatively speaking - intuitive to learn and easy to use.  Now, no graphics beginner is going to say that -- it's still a complicated package, but for someone with a decent graphics background (though by no means an expert), it's straightforward.  I have used the help file to find things, but once I find them, they are intuitive to use - I need the help file, but not a textbook or a class to teach me what the help file means!

PhotoPaint is POWERFUL, yet fairly direct.  A HUGE improvement over Adobe PhotoShop.  I would definitely choose Corel over Adobe here.  The products are a significant investment, though, so I would weigh how much I'm doing graphics before spending to upgrade to Corel, if I already had PhotoShop.  However, for any new ""seats"", licenses, computers, etc., I would definitely go Corel.

I also used the CorelDRAW part of the package, and for how I use vector graphics, it may be a little better than Visio or PowerPoint, but not a big difference.  I might choose it over the others, but I wouldn't bother with the expense to upgrade to it.

Note:  The Suite also includes ""Trace"" and ""Capture"", but I haven't used these, so I can't review them.",0

"I've seen the reviews by others, and concur that the software lacks the bells and whistles of the newer full Roxio product (ver 7). BUT ... if you're looking for some simple features that don't hog a lot of drive space or CPU cycles, this earlier product (ver 6) fits the bill. I've been looking for a simple packet-writing program to drag-and-drop files for archiving or transfer between systems [your old floppy 'sneakernet'], and it's just right for that simple task. Window's XP file transfer is just miserable, as it treats a document like graphics material, storing it to disk, then writing track-by-track with balloons and other distractions. This package lets you format and write/delete to RW discs without hassle. Better yet, in ""Custom"" installation you can pick and choose the functions you need, and forget about the fancy 'Control Center'. For my simple needs it works like a charm at minimal cost.",0

"I purchased Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0 (3-user) so I could load it in my computer and my daughter's laptops. This software is very protective of my system. It has so many settings; I could see where it might be a little difficult for people not completely computer literate to figure out how to utilize its full potential. This software protects you in every area, from being on the internet to scanning your emails before you open them. It can become a little annoring if the settings are set too high. But once you get the hang of it, you'll be so glad you bought it. I guess most importantly, it gives you real piece of mind that your system is protected fully.
It will not slow your system down. And it does not take over your computer like many of the other brands. And Amazon performs great as usual. I've been a member of Prime since it's beginning and never had anything but great things to say about the service I have received.",0

I have used turbo tax for at least 10 years and it just keeps getting better. This is a great product.,0
"I have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I have found it easy to use.  I don't usually skip sections.  Just easier for me to go through each section.  No problem importing my data from the prior year.  A long while back I switched to another product because of calculations errors Turbo Tax made and while it guarantees the calculations it was such a hassle to prove to them it wasn't worth it so I switched.  I came back a few years later and there was no issue importing my data from a competing product.

I like the guided menus.  And this year's product seems to be just as easy to use and helpful.  This Premier product does offer features that use.  It may be more than others may need like stocks and bonds, for instance.

While it comes with one state download, it does not include a state e-file.  That gets to be expensive.  As is buying another state download which I need to do.  I have had issues with e-filing my resident state because Intuit did not include a copy of the other state return which is a requirement.  So I don't e-file and mail it in.  They said they would fix that, but I haven't seen anything that says they did.

All in all I like this product and it makes my life much easier.  I remember the days of taking pen to the 1040 and other forms and using a calculator... talk about stress.  I recommend this particular edition if you need the financial guidance for your investments.  Otherwise try a less expensive version.  You should find it very easy and intuitive.",0

"TurboTax has been my tax software choice for 15 years running. During that time, Intuit has offered better and weake versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.

If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped take the pain out of, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Before software, tax time was a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had a rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Those days are happily in the past

This version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.

With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?",0

"Although I've always known Norton's security products have a sterling reputation, at some point years ago I switched to another leading brand because my company had installed that brand on our work computers. At the time I thought they knew something I didn't know, but now I think they must have just gotten a good deal with the licenses. Switching back to Norton has been like a breath of fresh air!

The Norton software is easy to install. It updates and scans in the background; and in fact, it detects when the computer is idle and does quick virus scans and system checks - rather than the way their competitor did it, which was to skip scheduled sessions entirely if I wasn't logged in at the scheduled time.

Best of all, unlike the other guys, Norton doesn't bomb me with advertising for their other products, nor do they have a default opt-in to automatically renew and charge your credit card when your software is approaching expiration. (They let you know - they just don't beat you over the head with it.)

"Kaspersky offers the very best anti-virus engine. They have a small footprint and an exceptional product. They offer classes for free on their internet site on internet security and program usage.

"There are a lot more features in this software bundle than I realized at first.  My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).

I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.

Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.

Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.

The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.

Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.

Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.

I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.

This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.

All in all, this software has a lot of features for the money, more than I'll probably ever have reason to use.  But it's kept me busy for many hours, most of them enjoyable.  It's not perfect, but I think it's a good deal.",0

When compared to the other tax preparation software out there, there really isn't any comparison.  While Turbo Tax might cost more you get a far superior product.  When it comes to tax preparation software you get what you pay for.  I have never had a tax problem since I been using Turbo Tax. I have been using it for over 6 years now.  I like the basically idiot proof nature of the product.  It asks you simple yes or no questions and guides you step by step through everything so you don't miss a thing.  It even pointed out things I could deduct that I wasn't aware of.  If I can say anything negative about this product is the support is a bit lacking. It takes several days to get a reply to any support issues. The software also arrived 3 days before expected delivery date.",0

"Man, Ubuntu just keeps getting better! It's easy to install. It includes a LOT of extra software including the awesome OpenOffice.org office suite. You get a lot of games including Aisleriot Solitaire which includes TONS of different solitaire games from Thirteen to Klondike to Golf and so on.

"I was first introduced to Kaspersky Anti-Virus when I converted to Mac OS X over three years ago and installed Parallels Desktop, which cam with a year of Kaspersky that it installed automatically. Until then, I had not been too familiar with the application, but was blown away with its performance. I soon replaced McAfee and Trend Micro on all my work PCs with Kaspersky and have been very happy ever since. Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2011 has continued this performance.

Why do I think it is the best anti-virus software? Well, I judge mostly on performance. I must be honest and say that I have never had a virus or worm, etc. on any of my computers; so, I cannot talk much to how well this or any other anti-virus catches incoming threats. Other than flagging the occasional virus in an email attachment, I have no experience with dealing with serious threats.

So performance... In the olden days, there was Norton; and, Norton was good - briefly. Then it became a resource hog and seemed to want to take over the computer and its processing power. Luckily, better and faster and less intrusive options like McAfee and Trend Micro came along; but, even these started to become a little burdensome after a while. Then, enter Kaspersky. Kaspersky runs quietly in the background, doesn't hog the processor, and doesn't try to take over my computer. The other aspect I rate under performance is updating... Kaspersky updates almost daily, and does it well in the background without taxing the computer. That was an issue that came along with Trend Micro - both its initial scan and updating upon booting up the computer, it held up Windows from fully loading until it was done... often up to five minutes!

Kaspersky is the only anti-virus I use on all my computers at home and at the office.",0
I've been a user of Kaspersky for several years on 3 different computers and continue to enjoy having it protect my computers.  I used another Antivirus/Security program for several years before that but found that it placed files all over the computer and in one case interfered with my loading a program.  I got error messages until I removed all remnants of the old virus program in the registry and other places on the hard drive.  I finally got the program to load.  Kaspersky has given me absolutely no problems whatsoever.,0
"This review is entirely from the perspective of people looking at Photoshop alternatives, now that Adobe has switched to a monthly fee model with Creative Cloud.

I use to do computer graphics and fine arts more than a decade ago, but I don't work in that field, and so I only actually need to use a high end graphics program every few months or so.  I've used Photoshop for more than 10 years, but now that Adobe has gone to Creative Cloud with a monthly rental but no purchase option, I need an alternative.  I don't do graphics often enough to justify a monthly fee on the Adobe Creative Cloud plan, and I have concerns about whether I will be able to open files years into the future unless I can own the software.  My personal alternative is the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GIMP has a clunky user interface.  And, I also recommend software for a small university library where students and staff are also looking for something for occasional use.

Corel Painter 2015 has a decent user interface.  I was able to do simple edits quickly and intuitively.  I was also able to use the User Guide to quickly find and follow instructions for applying a mask.  There are a lot of options, because you can do a lot for it, so I think it's better for someone who has used a high-end graphics program before or who wants to be able to do more.  It was easy to find instructions for using the software.  There is a big long PDF User Guide, tutorials on YouTube (this is officially how Corel makes the tutorials available), and by Googling I could find websites where people talked about using the software.  So, you will be able to quickly find instructions on doing common tasks in Corel Painter.  One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.  I won't necessarily be able to go back to a tutorial a few years from now, since I can't store them with the software.

All in all, this is perfectly adequate software for editing digital images, and has a range that goes all the way up to fine arts.  There is a 30 day free trial to demo the software, and you can get this from Corel's website to try the software out.",0

"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
For those who are using Windows XP: There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it. Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

I renew this every year. It's great. It lets me use Microsoft word & I can then create documents as I need them. Highly recommend.,0
"I did my 100th upgrade to Windows XP Pro today, for a new client.  All 100 installations went smoothly without a hitch, and the 60+ that have been running for over 2 months have been running rock solid.  If you are coming from Windows 2000 Professional, expect a slight speed increase (assuming you have at least 256MB of RAM) and better stability.  None of the installations I have done, ranging from single desktop workstation to servers to WiFi-enabled laptops, has experienced any crash.  [Of course, the fact that I'm paid to do a good job must have something to do with it. ;) ]
The upgrade price is a bit too steep if you are already running Windows 2000.  If you have Windows 95, 98 or ME, then you should probably opt for Windows XP Home edition, which is considerably less expensive and just as speedy and stable as the professional edition... and will make your PC computing life so much more enjoyable.
Highly recommended.",0

Use Word and Excel constantly.  This version gives me all I need.,0
"It's been quite a while since the last Microsoft Office release for Macintosh, but so far, I'm very impressed with Office 2016 for Mac. The user interface has been freshened to match the Windows version and still remains very easy to use for day-to-day work, while being very powerful under the hood. Mastering Office for either platform will take some work, but there are few programs out there that have the following or power of the Microsoft Office suite.

Installation is very easy. You're directed to go to a web site, set up a Microsoft account and enter a 25 character product key. The download is a bit over 1gb, so if you have a slow Internet connection, it may take a while. Once the download is complete, run the installer which will want an administrators password. Once the installation process begins, it takes a few minutes to complete. My system has a solid state drive, so it was just over four minutes start to finish. Slower machines can take much longer.

The final step is to activate the installation which requires you to enter the email and password used to set up your Microsoft account.

Overall, I'm very happy with this release. Office 2011 was getting long in the tooth and the 2016 release will help ensure compatibility with other Office users.",0
"Video editing and authoring is generally an expensive proposition, and while this program is not perfect or professional grade&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Ulead-VideoStudio-11-5-Plus/dp/B0013OAHTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus</a>&nbsp;packs a wallop of features for a VERY good price, at least compared to what this software has historically cost.

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.

Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.

Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.

You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.

In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.

Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.

One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.

Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.

One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.

I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.

Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.

Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.

Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.

"I've used this modem since DSL came out, I still use it.

It's built like a tank and probably fair to say that it's better than using a new dsl modem.  Also, there is no router inside, which is good.  There is no complicated settings, you merely hook this up to a router.

There is no USB port.  Simply hook this up to the wan port of a router.

I have used this modem 24/7 for more years then I can count.",0
"Unlike some reviewers I had no problems installing or running any part on Windows 7 64bit. Everything worked well and was very easy to follow and fill in.

Yes, you can only have access to the Living Will for two years and make changes for only one year, but considering the cost of this entire package, compared to a lawyer's fees, how can anyone complain! I have no reluctance to recommend this download since it was super easy and worked flawlessly for me. It takes many hours to complete but one can return to work on it many times.

"Do NOT believe all the knee-jerk garbage you're hearing about Vista, as 90% of it is being pulled out of thin air by people who obviously never even tried it.  Linux and Apple trolls scour the internet for chances to add negative reviews to an operating system they'v never even tried.

Then there are the XP hypocrites who have been using XP for so long that they fear anything new.

Hypocrytes you say?  Yup.  This same negative ""new Windows sucks"" propaganda wave happened when Windows 2000 was released in 1999 (nobody wanted ""NT"") and again when XP was released in 2002 (incompatibility problems, verybody absolutely HATED that ""Made by PlaySkool"" interface). Everybody hated each of them until the next version of Windows came along. Then, suddenly, they LOVED the older version and tried to cling to it. Not only pathetic, but now very predictable.  Vista is just the latest victim.

I have absolutely no love affair with Microsoft, trust me.  But it's time for an actual professional with a masters in programming and operating systems to set a few things straight.

Fact: Windows Vista was in development a whole year before Windows XP was even released. Microsoft had been working feverishly on this OS for 6 years at the time of its release. Little id you know that nearly EVERY Microsoft product that comes out is extensively tested by a public usability testing program that is totally seperate from their beta testing program. Microsoft doesn't let anything out the door until all the usability testers (the general public that come to visit the Microsoft facility in Redmond, Wa) say they like it. Vista was OK'd by both internal and external beta testers in addition to the usability test program, or it never would have been released. I have personally done usability testing at Microsoft 17 times now (I like to get my 2 cents in), and I know how this process works. Microsoft releases software BY CONSENSUS, and Vista is what the people themselves ASKED FOR.

Fact: For its entire life, the virus magnet that is known as Windows XP has been solely responsible for the onslaught of spyware, malware and waves of viruses. Not Mac. Not Linux. Not DOS. Not Unix. It was Windows XP. Prior to XP, Windows would see a problem virus come down the pike once in a while.  Then XP came along, and we've been swimming in viruses and Malware ever since.  Even loaded with antispy and antivirus software, WinXP STILL gets infested and slows to a blue-screening crawl. As you read this on your XP box, I guarentee that you have spyware on your system. Run a scan and see for yourself.  If you're just running Windows Defender, I guarentee you're LOADED with it and don't even know it - get better software immediately.

Fact: Though complaints about Vista's UAC are many, the Internet is not filled with Vista users begging to be saved from viruses and spyware they can't recover from. Those poor souls are pretty much all XP users.  The Vista users complaing of any viruses and spyware are the ones who turned UAC off or clicked right past the UAC warning prompts without evn reading them.

Fact: OF COURSE Vista is going to be slightly slower than XP on the same machine - just like Windows XP was slower than Windows 2000, which was much slower than Windows NT4, etc. etc. This is the natural way things are SUPPOSED TO BE AS HARDWARE GETS FASTER AND FASTER. C'mon, what do you honestly expect? New operating systems are about new features, not ""running faster"" on the same hardware (anybody that knows anything about operating systems knows that new versions are NEVER faster than the previous version, no matter what operating system it is - just take a look at any Linux distro or new version of any Mac OS). It's up to HARDWARE to make things run faster, not the OS. Your system is not fast enough to run Vista? THEN GET FASTER HARDWARE LIKE YOU HAD TO DO FOR XP. Has everyone forgotten that today's hardware is anywhere from 4-10 times faster than than the hardware that was available when XP was first released? And that XP absolutely crawled on our systems when it first came out and that we all complained about it?  And that Vista runs at virtually the same speed as XP once booted up - only with tons of new features? And that soon you will need a new OS to even be able to operate the dual quads already on the market and the dual octo-core systems right arounnd the corner? C'mon, people, get a grip and get kick that common sense glad into gear.

Fact: Since SP1 came out, Vista runs GREAT. I can run any Win32 program I want in Vista that I install, and as of SP1.  I might even be able to run old 16 bit apps now, haven't tried that yet.  Thanks to the freeware release of VDMSound, I am running old DOS games under Vista with full sound.  I repeat - DOS games.  Some of the few remaining software products currently being described as ""Non-Vista compatible"" can be made to work under Vista if you do a little reading and tweaking.

Fact:  Before SP1 came out for XP, XP ran like crap and had tons of compatibility problems.  Everybody hated it, even the way it looks.  Bet you forgot that.

Fact: Turn UAC (User Access Control) off if you want Vista to behave like XP and not prompt you for confirmations. It's as easy as un-checking a checkbox in Control Panel (User Accounts). Note: This will drop Vista security down to the same ""virus magnet/pants down"" level as Windows XP, however, so you decide.  The nice part is that you CAN decide.

Fact: Are you a gamer? Then you already know that Direct3D (DirectX) 10 is Vista-only. All you XP gamers can sit in your own DX9 drool if you want to. Meanwhile, we Vista users are walking around in DX10 games that look like movies. You oughtta see Crysis with dual nVidias running SLI.

Fact: Think you don't like Vista? Waiting for Windows 7 to come out in Q1 of 2010 (at the earliest without any of Microsoft's now legendary and predictable postponements)? You might be interested in knowing that Windows 7 is merely a re-packaging of Windows Vista - just like Windows XP was a re-packaging of Windows 2000 because 2000 didn't sell well (see for yourself at the command prompt - type ""ver"" and take note that Windows 2000 is Windows version 5.0 and Windows XP is version 5.1). Windows Vista is version 6.0. Dig up all the screen shots of Windows 7 you can find on the internet - take note that the title is ""Windows 7"" but the version number is 6.1.  In other words, STILL VISTA. So get used to Vista. Better yet, GET Vista, or you'll eventually be two Windows versions behind when 7 comes out - which won't be until 2010 (at the earliest), and then that version of Vista will be around for 5 years until the next version.

Vista's here to stay, folks. You have a choice of slipping into even more obsolescence with XP (which is just Windows 2000 with lipstick, a 9 year old product) or you can move forward with Vista and Win7.

For me personally, Vista has been spoiling me rotten since SP1 came out. Every time I get up from my Vista machines and sit down on my XP machines, it feels like I'm sitting down on a machine in ""Safe Mode"". Vista makes XP feel old, limited, cumbersome and inadequate. The search functions of Vista alone remove all need for clicking through layers of start menus, even often allowing me to not have to touch the mouse - this alone makes XP feel like an antique. I won't even get into how cool Desktop Search is, SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, or the other many new features that make Vista MUCH faster than XP in many respects.  Read that last sentence again, and then look those things up.  You may commence drolling on your poor ol' outdated XP box's keyboard.

BTW: No, I do not work for Microsoft, and I have been a huge Linux fan since 1997 (SUSE Linux, to be exact, version 11 is fantastic).  I ignore the fact that Linux always takes much longer for apps to load up (and runs clunkier in general) and that both KDE and Gnome always seems to look/work a lot like the latest version of Windows.",0
"First off, I suppose I'll have to start by stating that I initially knew very little about the Japanese language, other than little snippets spoken to me from old Godzilla movies and various anime titles. To an outside viewer any foreign language can seem like a perplexing challenge to take on. It usually requires regiments of classes and years of complex study. When Rosetta Stone advertized itself as being able to teach foreign languages in an easy, concise manner, I was very skeptical. Now that I've spent a few months using this software in the small gaps that open up during my busy schedule, my skepticism has completely dissolved.

While I can't claim to have gained mastery of the Japanese language, I can say that I've learned quite a lot by utilizing this outstanding software. The program allows the user to work with a headset, in which you speak various words and sayings into a microphone. Feedback is given on how well you pronouce these words and compared alongside the audio samples of native speakers. The visual techniques employed by the software is also very effective; the mind is immersed in a catalog of recognizable images that methodically builds up a network of associations and helps to gently increase your powers of memory.

While most study involved in Foreign Languages can be ardous and painful, Rosetta Stone somehow manages to turn the ordeal into a pleasent experience. The program is very user-friendly without being overly patronizing, and it ran very smoothly on my system without any sort of technical problems. I was honestly expecting some sort of technical hiccup due to the complex nature of the programming, but one never presented itself.

But perhaps the greatest aspect of Rosetta Stone is it's casual-though-effective structure to teaching. I found that simply using the program for just an hour a day proved to show progress, with most lessons taking 30 minutes or less to complete. It doesn't force its users to dedicate large portions of their life time in order to make progress. The way the lessons are timed and structured, one could come closer to understanding a foreign language while still maintaining a full and busy life with career, friends, and family.

Overall, I found Rosetta Stone to an effective tool in learning Japanese. I've only had the time to get through level 1 of the course, but I'm already inching my way closer to speaking and writing the alphabets of Japanese, without sacrificing any time from my normal schedule. It is highly recommended to everyone.",0
"Microsoft's 2009 Streets and Maps comes with a small GPS and all of the software guts needed to stay on track perfectly, so perfectly, in fact, that my daughter took it for herself and is using it in another city.

The anti-virus is now part of the OS. I did the whole install within Windows 7. Upon completion Metro appeared, when I flipped to my desktop it was as the same original 7. Wallpaper, folders and programs were all there. MS Office, Chrome and Firefox. IE10 is remarkably fast. Plus works great with a mouse.

"This product is considerably faster than the Photoshop Elements and the other components of the Elements series. It's also about 25% cheaper. Insofar as features are concerned there is hardly any difference in their capabilities, but what's astonishing with this particular product is the amazing attention given to the help documentation. This company really wants you to learn their product, as there are differences between this and the other Photoshop-like products. For instance, instead of layers, CorelPhoto refers to them as objects. Pasting an alt-print-screen graphic is subtly different from the way Photoshop does it: you have to select a different option from the Edit menu, ""Copy from Clipboard"". The terminologies used in Corel products are different from Photoshop, but just as sensible. It takes very little patience to get used to them.

There is a price-war going on between top notch photo/drawing programs, and the winner will be determined by how fast their customers learn to use them. Even the free products in this category will have to battle it out in this regard. Expediently educating your customer is the key to success, and CorelDRAW X5 is ahead, for now.",0

"I used to run large companies and was watched the development of these accounting programs grow through the years.  A program like this, even just 15 years ago would cost thousands of dollars, not, a couple of hundred.  I have a few small business, and go from NO software, to ""lite"" software such as Quicken, and in the past, Peachtree (which is this products previous predecessor).  While for most small businesses, even software of this level is overkill, I would strongly suggest, if it helps keep u organized, its worth it.  That has always been my problem.  I would have spreadsheets, online banking, payroll companies, Quicken pay, etc.  I realize the value of keeping all these chores under the same umbrella, but in the past, I always struggled with the constant learning curves, updates, shortcomings of the accounting software which forced me back to spreadsheets, databases, etc  So its been 6+ years since I tried an all encompassing accounting program, so seeing this on Vine, it motivated me to try again.

My initial reaction to this product is.... its quite comprehensive.  A huge step up from Quicken for Business and Microsfts previous attempts at accounting software.  Screens seem intuitive. As for payroll, it appears you need an ongoing subscription for this.  Many people rely on outside payroll services for this, as for the small fee they charge, its a lot of hassle a small business person does not have to deal with.  Much of this depends on how many people are on your payroll.  The more people, the more you can amortize the account costs over... if you employ 2-10 people, u should consider a 3rd party payroll company...such as Paychex.

It appears the Premium version of Sage 50 is better suited for contractors (job cost, change orders, etc) and for those who inventory a lot of product.  So be sure to pick the right software.  I noticed you can download a 30 day free trial on Sages web site.  Kudos to Sage for allowing users to try before you buy....IMO, that offer alone says a lot about the company.  I did not see an upgrade path if you decide you need the premium.  I also am not sure what the continual upgrades cost, and if they are mandatory.  All software companies need continued revenue from existing customers to support the constant need to re write software to accommodate changes in operating systems, compatibility with firewalls, security software, etc.  It would be nice if Sage explained this in a bit more detail.

I will be slowly integrating my businesses over to Sage, so will do my best to update this review....its not a simple product to review, unless one has been using it for some time.  Or, will use it full time such as an accountant for a small company.  But most small companies, the owner is the accountant, sales rep, HR, QC, etc.  ;)",0

If you have a small business and are looking for an easy to use accounting system, this is highly recommended!",0
"Over the years I have criticized Quicken for bugs etc. This is a nice polished version. I am installing it now so I have release 2. It is a good priced product, polished over several decades. Went on perfectly - and added a reasonably priced and efficient online backup at 1/4 the cost of the previous OLB. They give us a lot for our money. I do wish they had the great free support they had only a few years ago. I never need CS but it is nice to know it is there! Few other firms give us this much for the money.",0

"This version of Family Tree Maker comes with a free, six-month membership to Ancestry.com, which is just about the right amount of time for the casual user to research and create a full family tree. Although you could do the research manually, Ancestry.com consolidates a tremendous amount of information from divers historical documents and makes it relatively easy and efficient to discover information about relatives from long ago.

Family Tree Maker Deluxe allows the user to create (and back-up) genealogy offline before submitting it online, so it's my preferred method. You can work with your tree online, but by using the program on my home computer, then syncing when done, I avoid Internet glitches or user errors that cause lost data. So far, I haven't encountered any problems with this software, or with synching.

With this version for Mac, you can capture photos with iSight and import them directly into your Ancestry.com tree. If you don't own a scanner, this may be the best way to add pictures or copies of documents. Just make sure there is plenty of light for a clear picture.

Also included are the six reference training books on CD (see product description). I found them all useful; be sure to at least skim through them.

Family Tree Maker has been a good program for genealogy for years. I used it many years ago when it was just starting out and before it became PC-only. If you own a Mac, then I think you'll appreciate that there is now a version for us. The features built in to this program make it much better than the first version I used, and I liked that one. Since it also comes with research training books (on CD) and a free six-month membership to Ancestry.com it becomes a great package at a decent price.",0
There are a lot of genealogy software choices out there. I really like Family Tree maker. I've used it and grown with it for many years now. Like a lot of software it's added many new features across the years and their great though sometimes I miss the simpler interface and presentation of previous versions. Couple this software with a subscription to Ancestry.com and you got perhaps the best combination of genealogy resources available.,0

"Until now my main reason for running Windows on my mac mini was to handle a proprietary program from my employer that required Windows.

That program now works with Fusion, and I'm a much happier camper.  Fusion lets me see both Mac and PC drives at once, run both operating systems at once, and avoid rebooting all the time.  Rebooting is painful and timeconsuming.

Office 2003 runs fine, and the other programs I use run fine.  installation was beyond simple, and Fusion has both a supportive community and decent technical support.

No, I can't magically run graphics-intensive games on my relatively slow Mac Mini.  But I can't do that well in the mac OS on that setup either, especially since my monitor is an HDTV.

To sum up:  no gotchas, easy install, convenient to use, plenty of options.  AND NO MORE REBOOTING.",0

"This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon. This Gigabit switch (and it's larger ProSafe Plus kin) has port mirroring and other advanced functions for comprehensive service quality, diagnosing, and monitoring of network traffic on-the-cheap. It's impossible to find this stuff in the average, everyday un-managed switches at the lower end of the price pool where this one also swims.

To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.

Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.",0

"I've long promoted AVG's free products to friends who asked my opinions. I've tried them myself, and they provide an acceptable level of service- great news, considering the price. However, after a terrible experience with a well-known security product several years ago (see my other reviews for details), I swore off all security programs, deciding instead to be vigilant with my machines and my internet activities as a better way to protect my machines. Recently, though, I've tried several new products, and haven't had any major issues with any of them (though there have been some minor frustrations- see below). AVG Internet Security 2011 is the best I've seen, though, by far.

After test-driving Norton 360 on my 'junk' machine, and being frustrated with the way it tends to make decisions FOR the user, instead of giving the user options on how to handle potential threats, I was hoping to find a product that would be equally vigilant in detecting potential issues without taking the machine over. AVG Internet Security 2011 does just that. As you may know, some programs register 'false-positives' with security software- they are safe programs, but they exhibit some characteristics that trigger suspicion. That's fine- if my security software thinks there may be a threat, I want to know about it. However, some security software (like Norton) take the initiative of deleting or quarantining automatically, and this can be very frustrating. AVG engages the user at every juncture, presenting options to clean, delete, or make exemptions for such software. This is very helpful.

More generally, AVG runs silently, it doesn't use up a lot of resources, and its notification system is great- notices are displayed as corner pop-ups that don't distract, but are easy to review if desired. I never really had any issues before I got AVG, and haven't had any since, but it's great to know I'm protected without having to sacrifice performance or worry about the program doing something I don't want it to without my knowledge.

In brief, AVG Internet Security 2011 is a sound investment, and the fact that customer service is available makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the free versions. Highly recommended for anyone looking for effective, non-intrusive security for their PC.",0

Overall, very satisfied with the program and it's compatability.",0
"Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.",0
"Disclaimer: I am not a tax expert and do not claim to be one. However, I believe this ""standard"" edition of TurboTax that I have been asked to review has filed my taxes incorrectly.

Last year, I was unemployed and the IRS offers so called free filing through various companies if your income is below a certain limit so I tried the free version TurboTax offered through the IRS.  When I told them I had a HSA, suddenly I was no longer able to file taxes through TurboTax even though I met the income limit.  A HSA is nothing complex, it's a savings account for healthcare expenses, but suddenly I no longer qualified for free filing. Instead, they tried to upsell me to an expensive version.  This seems like a scam.

This year, I elected to review this retail version of Turbotax and the question of whether or not I had a HSA was not mentioned at all.  Fine, maybe laws changed because of the ACA and HSA's no longer matter.  TurboTax wanted to charge an extra $39 to file taxes for my state which I declined.

For no particular reason, I decided to look through a tax booklet (not included with TurboTax) and it seems I was supposed to include a Form 8889 with my taxes to show if I had deposited or withdrawn money from my HSA.  Because of this I believe TurboTax filed my taxes incorrectly, and I will need to go through the hassle of making corrections to my return.

Looking at the back of the TurboTax box, there are four (!) different versions to buy but there is nothing saying which version you should use if you have a HSA. So being unable to find the correct version of Turbotax to fit your needs may cause your taxes to be filed incorrectly.  This product claims to be able to file a 1040A which I normally use, but the truth is, it's only good for a 1040EZ and anyone should be able to file a 1040EZ on their own.

As a result, I don't recommend you use this product and I will not use it in the future.",1
"I just started using this about a week ago.  I have gone through the first disk (I had a lot of third-year Spanish courses in college.) This is version 9.  According to the TellMeMore website, the latest version is Version 10, which is a completed rewrite.  They sell 10 Levels Version 10 for $549 and this one for $374.  They have an on-line demo.

I majored in German and also studied a lot of Spanish, so I am familiar with the various teaching methods.  Their method is a good mix, since it works on all six main areas of language: reading, writing, speaking, aural comprehension, grammar and vocabulary.

Actual news broadcasts is a particularly useful approach, since ALL language-learning programs basically use highly-scripted text.

They also have a 10+2 level package where the final two lessons are business-specific vocabulary.

The user interface could use some improvement.  It took several hours for me to stumble on how to do the crosswords and Audio Comprehension questions.  For crosswords, after you type in a word you have to click the ""solution"" icon, a lightbulb in the upper right corner.  It then gives you the next word. Normal reaction is that you would only click the solution icon if you just don't have a clue and NEED the answer rather than HAVE the answer. For the Audio Comprehension questions, after you select the answer you also have to click the solution icon so the progress report will show you have completed that task.

There is one incredibly annoying thing with the crosswords ... the program distinguishes between accented and unaccented words that have the exact same pronunciation.  So, for instance, if you type l instead of el or t instead of tu (or vice versa) it considers it an error. They don't say ""el -- article"" or ""l - pronoun"".  You just have to guess!

I DID NOTICE ONE SIGNIFICANT ERROR -- THEY GOT THE ALPHABET WRONG! Spanish has four letters that don't exist in English: ch, ll,  and rr.  For instance, chico has four letters, not five.  They don't list the ch or ll letters. As you go in further they eventually provide a LIST of the 29 letters. [Should be 30.  I originally said there were 3 extra letters and recently noticed the error.  I haven't used the program in awhile, so I don't know whether it shows 29 or 30.] But, by that time you are already used to thinking ""say -- ache -- ee -- say -- o"" (Chico) instead of ""chay -- ache -- say -- o"").  Also, you can't input the extra letters, which reinforces the error.  (They DO have clickable options for accented vowels and .)

The ""practice a phoneme"" drills do have animated graphics giving a basic idea of placement of the tongue, etc.  However, they use technical terminology only someone with linguistics training would know.  (Where is the alveolar ridge?)  Also, at least the diagram for t is wrong.  It describes an English t, where the tongue does not touch the teeth.  A Spanish t is a dental sound, meaning the tongue touches the back of the top teeth.

In the written portions, the program does distinguish non-English characters such as , ,  and  to force proper spelling but does not accept such characters from the United States-International keyboard layout.  Therefore, every time you have to input such a character you have to pick it from a chart with the mouse instead of just inputting it from the keyboard with right-alt plus the letter.

The program is also mouse-intensive. When you finish a question you can't just press Tab or Enter to move to the next screen, you have to go to the upper right hand and click the Next button.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it does quickly become annoying.

From what I have seen so far, having worked through the first disk, this is really not a program for someone who just wants to learn a little Spanish for vacation travel. It puts quite a bit of emphasis on proper word order, spelling (including proper letter accents), and even punctuation.

Because of the way lessons are broken down, you can repeatedly access a particular section and get repeated variations.

There are a few simple things it should mention early on that would make learning spelling and pronunciation much easier for beginners.  For instance, it could mention that Spanish is almost 100% phonetic. Also, that the voice accent goes on the final syllable but on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable if the word ends in a vowel or n or s, and in ANY multi-syllable word that does not follow that pattern you have to write an accent, e.g., seis but diecisis; nmero; sbado.  Also that pronouns get accents and adjectives/articles don't: he = l, you = t, but el = the and tu = your.  Also that question words get accents and non-question adverbs (etc.) don't: Where are you = dnde? but I know where = donde, How are you = cmo? but this s LIKE that"" = como, etc.

Judging from the demo, this program is EXTREMELY customizable.  There are six major categories and you can select which ones you want, ratios, etc.  For instance, if you are primarily interested in being able to read you could set it to emphasize that rather than speaking and aural comprehension. Judging from descriptions from professional reviewers, Tell Me More seems to be the ""Rolls Royce"" of language-learning programs.  Although I have only been using it a short while and am just starting to get a good idea of the features, I think I would agree.  (My undergrad major was languages and linguistics, I spent a year in a Ph. D. program in linguistics and German, and I have studied German, Yiddish, Spanish, French, Russian, biblical Hebrew, Latin, and English linguistics and I have about 90 semester hours in various foreign language courses at the post-secondary school level.)

Although this seems pretty expensive, 2009-2010 tuition for just one 3-semester hour course at Houston Community College, for example, for a Texas resident living outside Houston is $338 plus fees, etc. And beyond second year, college language courses focus on literature, so you don't learn a lot of words you would need in everyday use.

The Nuance voice recognition is VERY good and doesn't require ""training"" the program. It can pick up the difference, for instance, between aspirated (the puff of breath with English initial p) and unaspirated p and dental (Spanish) versus (English) alveolar t.  When practicing sentences, it will point out the particular word that needs to be practiced.

An important point regarding voice-recognition sentence practice: It expects you to pronounce each word separately. Even if you pronounce them clearly, if you run words together it considers it wrong.  (Actually, American news anchors, actors, etc., say each word separately, but most people don't realize it.)

As you get more advanced, the program provides an increasing variety of activities. So far I have found it very good and still interesting, even though I am going over basic introductory material.",0
"One of the things I most like about WordPerfect is that Corel doesn't constantly change for the sake of change.  I'm a lawyer and I find the ability to do things with hot-keys rather than clicking through a bunch of menus or guessing which hieroglyph on a ""ribbon"" performs a rarely-used function is a huge time-saver.  I simply COULD NOT write efficiently without Reveal Codes -- if I either need to see why something isn't right or I need to do some odd stuff, just press F11 and there is all the ""behind the scenes"" stuff.

I also like the fact that when I add things like Widows and Orphans control, Keep Text Together, etc., it ACTUALLY DOES. I hate when in Word I click on something like Keep Text With Next -- and nothing happens.

I was using X4 and the version I had didn't come with a ""migrate setting"" option. X6 gave me that option and it migrated virtually everything. I noticed it didn't use my highly customized template (completely different menus, custom toolbar, custom keyboard). I was slightly annoyed and went to copy my ""X4 custom"" to ""X6 custom"". The install had already done that. The only thing it didn't do was set my Default Template to the new copy. I pointed Default Template to the new copy, changed Default Document Folder, set the Theme I like, and it's good to go.

A few problems I'm sure haven't been fixed, so I might as well mention them.  (I reported them to Corel years ago on numerous occasions but they never fixed them.) When certain formatting is to be applied to selected text that crosses a page boundary, the formatting is only applied up to the page boundary.  For instance, I sometimes have to block-indent several paragraphs that cross a page boundary. I hilite the text and press F4 (left indent) or Shift-F4 (left-right indent). All the paragraphs up to the page boundary will indent, but subsequent ones won't.  Annoying that they've never fixed it, but certainly not a major problem.",0
"This is the second year that I've purchased H&R Block Premium + State Tax prep software. I'd been wanting to try it for years, but my husband always did our taxes (some exercise in self-flagellation that I've never understood...) prior to that and despite the struggle putting pen to paper, he was reluctant to e-file until he made a mistake on our 2013 taxes. Not wanting to appear overly eager to dive in with the tech-rescue I suggested tax prep software and letting me have a go at it.  He mulled it over and said OK, so I then started reading reviews; deciding to go with H&R based upon the positives I'd read.

I had not completed my own taxes for over 25 years, so I was a tad intimidated by the prospect of doing them at all. Fortunately my experience with last year's H&R software was very positive, and left me feeling empowered, not fearful that I'd done it incorrectly.

Ultimately there were no errors and the filing was quickly accepted by the feds with an extremely fast e-file to refund payment. (My husband was THRILLED with that part of it!) That experience led me to purchase the 2015 software for tax preparations this year.

Right now my daughter is applying to colleges and we'll be filling out the FAFSA (Federal Financial Aid form) and the CSS Profile (Financial Aid form for private colleges) on January 1st. While I don't expect to have all the info I need to complete my taxes on that day, if I do I can use this software to easily complete it and accurately fill out these forms. If I don't have the info it's recommended to estimate earnings and taxes on the forms, but then after e-filing taxes, that info can quickly be uploaded to replace estimates. Yet another reason that e-filing is the way to go.

As for using this software in general, having all the proper information (W-2's etc...) was really important, as was having a list of deductions (we did itemized deductions due to a large number of medical bills). I needed the Premium version as I'm an independent contractor (freelance writer), and this version addresses self-employment (Schedule C reported income).

I like how this software 'interviews' you. It asks you questions and if you don't know the answer it offers help as to where to locate the information and tries to clarify information as needed. H&R also offers help to users via unlimited online chat with tax experts. You can work on part of your return and then save it to come back to it. It's a process that could take months or a few hours depending upon how complicated your return is and whether or not you have all the required information.

I purchased the 'Frustration Free' option and it came in a plain, white cardboard envelope inside an Amazon box with other items. I nearly threw it out thinking it was packing material!  The CD and installation instructions with an Activation code are what you get. Installation on my Windows 7 PC was super easy, and last year's tax info (W2s, 1099s and last years return) was immediately imported by this year's software.

According to the software the next update will be January 7th. Updates are fairly frequent, but the software offers to check for one each time you open it so you're never out of date. You also are asked what state return you wish to file, and this too is updated as needed.

In paying for this software you have up to 5 Federal returns for free. The State filing costs an additional $19.95 per return. You can input your credit card info for that transaction securely through the software.

While a tad daunting at first (because I didn't want to mess anything up...) this software does a great job at guiding the user to a successful conclusion. It explains things in effective detail so the user feels informed versus overwhelmed. The logical progression of needed information in the software makes it easier for users who are unfamiliar with doing their own taxes to gather the needed information and have it at their fingertips to add to the software. Filing both the federal and state returns is done easily, and error checking (accuracy review) is done multiple times prior to filing to ensure you have accurately filled out the forms and maximized your deductions.

H&R Block has produced a useful bit of software that techs and non-techs alike can effectively use to complete their taxes. It's Q&A style in gathering information is easy to follow and the results are better than expected.  It's a product that produced accurate, fast results for us last year, and it's the product I knew I wanted to buy this year too because of my prior year's experience.

If you're doing your own taxes, I highly recommend it.

----------------------------------

UPDATE: 2/18/16

Finished my taxes (Federal and State) with this software to provide accurate FAFSA information for a college bound student. The software submitted my e-file and I had the Federal portion accepted within minutes of submission, and the State portion accepted the next day.

Since I had to pay federal taxes this year I deferred payment by direct removal from my checking account (something you can direct the software to do as late as 4/18/16) instead of paying a fee to pay by credit card.

Taxes are not fun, but this software definitely makes them easier to submit and understand.

"This is a justified upgrade for all Office 97, 2000 and some Office XP users. Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.
Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.
Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.
Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with ""Clear Type"" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.
PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.
This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.
Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under.
Outlook Business Contact Manager is an application that offers features for Small Businesses for generating customer reports and e-mailing customers.
Picture Manager has replaced Photo-Editor; it has better image editing tools, more functionality and ease of use.
Office 2003 is a worthy upgrade for many users, especially persons still in an existing Office 97 or 2000 user base. The tools it provides offers a powerful productivity experience that makes information accessible, controllable and connected for you the user.
The suite and all the Office 2003 applications are supported only on Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows XP all editions.",0
"I like it because I'm familiar with this software, via their Edit Pro MX.  This 2016 version has some improvements over the older versions, and a bug fixed on the title function (I can move the title bar anywhere, and the video bars stay where you leave them).  It's easy to overlap, fade in & out, black out, reduce volume or remove it; sharpen and brighten.  I don't like the fancy effects; just good, solid editing is what I need. This one works for me.",0

"Roxio Creator has been around for a long time. I've gone through at least 4 other versions and have nothing but praise for the product. It works and works well. Every version adds new features and this version, Creator NXT is no exception.

Usually I upgrade my Roxio software when I upgrade Windows and I need the newer version of Roxio to work with the new versions of Windows. I upgraded this time after going to Windows 8.  This doesn't surprise me as CD/DVD software hooks into the storage code of the operating system to do its thing. Change that code (as in a Windows upgrade) and Roxio needs to be updated. In the past, I only cared about the DVD/CD writing capabilities of Roxio. But after seeing the new software included with NXT, I find I'm really using the new programs. These new programs are Videowave (video editing), Convert (captures and converts videos to different formats), Paintshop Pro (photo editing), and Audio capture and conversion. Most of the time, you access these programs from the Roxio menu screen by selecting what you want to do and the menu launches the program you need to do the task.

Some of the new features that I find the most useful include:

Converting video to the best format to transfer to your tablet, phone, or share online.
Capture videos from websites (like Youtube).
Making slideshows from photos (including adding soundtracks) then converting to video format.
Convert audio formats (great for converting your CDs to MP3s for your iPod/iPhone.
Make a DVD with multiple movies and menus for accessing them.

These are just a few of the many features available (not enough space to list them all here).  All these features are only great if they work well. And they do. I haven't really mentioned the main reason for this software to exist.. and that is to burn CDs and DVDs. As I mentioned, Roxio Creator has been around for a while. It started out being just a CD burning program and it always has done that well.

This is my 5th version of this software and won't be my last!",0

"I am dictating this review using MacSpeech Dictate. If I have to make a correction with my keyboard I will indicate the correction using brackets.

My wife knew I wanted this program so she bought [it] for me for Christmas. I had read many of the reviews and had decided I would wait until some of the bugs have [had] been worked out. So it was with some reticence that I loaded the program onto my computer Christmas day. From some of the reviews I thought it would blow my computer up. However, with some encouragement from my daughter I decided to install it. It was surprisingly easy. I did have two [to] download the patch from the MacSpeech website. But I was prompted to do so and everything went smoothly (I have a wireless Internet connection which made it easy).

It took me about 20 minutes to do the training. It went well. However, the first few times I tried to dictate it didn't go well. At first I feared it was a complete waste of money. After working with it for a while thing[s] started [to] work better until finally it seemed to work perfectly. I did do a few of the training exercises over again, just to be on the safe side. As you can see it's doing a pretty good job. Occasionally I use the recognition menu which allows you to verbally select from a list of options. This is especially good if there is a lot of background noise. I'm actually using it occasionally right now because I find it easier to dictate while I look at the screen. The manual tells you not to do that but for some reason for me it works better. I look at the screen while I type so it seems natural for me to look at the screen while I dictate.

So what initially seemed like a potential disaster turned out to be a lot of fun. I never let on to my wife that her gift initially terrorized me.

I don't really understand those who bash the program. Maybe they type a lot better than I do. In the final analysis I give MacSpeech Dictate high marks. Naturally it makes mistakes, and the mistakes can be hard to find because the program never misspell[s] anything. But all things considered it truly is amazing.

[I]incidentally, there is a great manual in the help menu. It has everything I needed to know about the program, plus some that [I] haven't gotten to yet but hope[d] to learn about soon (like using it to do commands in programs like Photoshop).

I dictated this review with only eight typos. That's a lot better than if I had typed everything.",0
"McAfee Internet Security is a quality product. It installs and updates easily. I installed the software on two
different computers. A $250 laptop with an AMD E-processor, and an expensive desktop with an AMD Quad-core processor. The time difference to install was 12 minutes for the laptop and 2 minutes for the desktop. The protection is quite good, and the simplicity of the program makes it easy to use for most general users to have control of their anitivirus/internet security program. Options are easy to find and use. I didn't have any problems installing or with the program while I used it. Most internet security programs are similar and offer quality protection against viruses.

In comparison to the pro version it provides an additional special effects package within the program. It allows you to create high quality special effects, cinematic style titles, almost natural screen handwriting, image correction, and animated pen effects.

"This review is being written by someone who has never been mistaken for anything other than someone who can pick up a pen or pencil and scribble something. I cannot draw or make anything resembling a realistic visualized image that has been converted for other people to view. This program however allowed me to create realistic paintings that did a better job than my hand otherwise would have if someone were to give me a paintbrush.

I'm not saying this should take the place of paint and canvas or that it was the paintbrushes' fault. No but this program allows someone with no talent in this art form, like me, to be guided a little better to what fits me as I try to recreate anything on the screen.

For instance the multifarious functions that allow you to change which kind of stroke to use or the method of the stroke (watercolors, paintbrush, pencil) acted a portable art studio with everything at my disposal. I previously had no real knowledge of the different types of things that I could use. This program had it all in front of me (with help menus I might add) that taught me along the way as I learned to use this program.

I used just a mouse (no stylus) so my precision was probably hindered a bit, although I don't think having more control would have helped me much, remember I am not a visual artist. So in essence I'm speaking for people out there that want the bare minimum of this program in that you are buying solely the program itself.

Great aspects of program:
- Has every brush stroke I could think of, with all sizes and shapes to use in an instance
- Has a color palette allowing you to choose any color or mix thereof to suit your need
- Even with a mouse, I was able to create very succinct precision, surprisingly
- Acts as an art studio and art teacher, in that if you haven't caught on to how to make paintings through conventional means this program actually acts as a guide that may be easy to learn from then other forms

Obviously you know that this review is not for the professional for I am just an average everyday software junkie who has no knowledge or art or drawing or programs thereof. I can say, however, that this program was smooth to install, extremely easy to use and taught me some things about drawing on a computer I was never aware of. For that matter, it allowed me to do things with a ""virtual"" paintbrush I never thought I could do. So if there is a budding or curious artist in your, I suggest this program will get you there quicker than a complete art studio would. Of course you are saving much more money too.",0

"I want to first say that anyone who is NOT running anti-virus software should really get some - any - antivirus software on their systems immediately. It's not only about losing your own data. It's about your system being turned into a robot to send out millions of spam messages a day. If your system is open and unprotected, it in essence can be taken over by anyone on the web. This could turn you into a porn system, a spam system, or many other kinds of illegal systems without you ever knowing. You really need to keep your system locked for your safety as well as the safety of others. Never mind your legal implications if you let your unprotected system become a storehouse of child porn. (""Really officer, I had no idea ..."")

McAfee and Norton are traditionally two of the big names in the PC protection world. We have used both on and off over the years. Recently we have given the edge to Norton for their anti-virus software abilities. You only need one virus to hit you to wipe out your data and to turn your machine into a porn-distributing robot. When we had the opportunity to try McAfee, we thought we might as well see how it was doing.

The first thing I have to say is you CANNOT review an antivirus software package after only a week of us!! That is not a valid test. You need to use it for months to see how it actually performs. This is a long term software package, not one that works for a week and tells you much of anything. That is like buying a retirement stock portfolio and judging it after a week's worth of time.

So we've had this for several months now. Issue 1. It really slows down your system. Far more than other systems do. Since most of us use our computers for things that we do not want to wait 8 hours to complete, a slow system is not a good thing. There is no reason for the system to crawl the way it does when McAfee is running.

Even more importantly though it does NOT provide reliable virus protection. I might even accept a slower system if I knew it was being properly protected. However, it is not! The system that was running McAfee on it got hit with a virus that Norton blocked on our other systems. That right there is the ultimate failure mark. If you are running anti-virus software on a system, and it gets  a virus anyway that damages data, just what was the purpose of the slow anti-viral software? Especially when other software at the same price did its job properly.

We haven't tried yet, but we've also heard that this software auto-bills yearly without asking your permission and that canceling the software is a royal pain in the butt. That is the death knell as far as we are concerned.

Buy Norton. Stay away from McAfee, at least this 2008 version.",0
"Know your prices. Getting this on Amazon was less expensive than renewing my subscription with Symantec. And having one price for 5 devices is frosting on the cake! This is just a product key card, you can download the software online.",0
"Thanks Symantec...you've officially change my attitude (for the better) about running security software!

I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.

Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.

So, after roughly another year of ""living on the edge"", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).

Here's what I noticed:
+ Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute.
+ Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick.
+ Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.

About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.

So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!",0
"I can't believe this upgrade isn't getting a solid five star rating!!!

Sure, it took over an hour to install. When I restarted I opened mail and I was prompted for my mail settings (WHATT??).  However, when I hit the ""next"" prompt the mail started up with all my message intact (whew!).

Okay, so what's so good about Snow Leopard?  First of all, your system will run much faster.  Safari opens faster and text loads quicker when your browsing web pages (although the photos load a little slower it seems).

Mail seems to open faster.

The new ""aqua"" desktop looks a little nicer (okay, that's worth about $5 to me).

The system shuts down faster.

All in all, for $25, this is a very worthwhile upgrade that will feel like you just upgraded your system to a faster processor.

So, it's worth it. Now everybody, let's get with the program and rate this upgrade five stars!",0
Love them! Beautiful color!,0
"I'm a big Mac user, but my job uses PCs. That's always been an issue for me working on programs that aren't Mac. I wind up working twice as hard to make files compatible between both platforms, and half the time I lose formatting.

I never tried a virtual program before, and I have to say, with so many others, that VMware Fusion is simplicity itself: drag and drop installation, opens PC programs seamlessly, and has my job easier since I can work from home, and move files over with no issues.

The only thing I'd say is to max out your RAM (but you're doing that anyway, aren't you?)

Highly recommend.",0
"This is about as perfect as it gets. This is my second year using this software (as opposed to QuickBooks). I loved it the first year I used it and continue to feel likewise with this newest version.

It is a snap to install, seems ""bug"" free (at least as of right now and following some pretty serious use), and it is incredibly intuitive/easy to use. In fact, the ease of this program is a time-saver for me ... and that means more time with me family. And, that is invaluable!

This is expertly developed, phenomenally well-tested, and worth every penny!

Bravo to Sage for making a product that consumers can truly invest their trust in!",0

"PC Mag [...] had rated this very highly which is how I learned of it.  The full article is available at [...].  It is a very good, inexpensive, dependable backup software application.  It has good flexibility and is user friendly (for a backup program).  It allows you to back up an entire hard drive or just selected folders and files.  You can do full or incremental backups and you can schedule them or initiate them manually.  I have mine scheduled for a full backup once a week and a daily incremental backup, all to a removable USB hard drive.  You can tell it to break the back up into 2 GByte slices so you can keep the backup hard drive nicely decluttered by running Windows defrag program from time to time.  We have a Windows XP operating system and it works very well with that.  The program also allows you to create a disaster recovery CD and a corresponding disaster recovery backup on a hard drive.  You can set levels for compression and encryption and set password protection or not.  The more the compression and encryption, the longer the backup takes but the smaller and more secure it is (the default values are fine for me).  You can also adjust the intensity of the backup effort so it will run more slowly in the background so it won't interfere with you while you are using the computer or more quickly if you schedule the backups to be done at night (as I do).  The manufacturer was very responsive when I had some initial questions about it.  Unlike Norton Ghost, which we also have, it will not communicate on-line when you tell it not to.

To add to my initial review one year later (January 2010): in a year of ownership I have greatly benefited by learning to depend on the program's termination features. You can have it just run the backup on schedule and stop, or after the backup you can also set it to automatically perform ""power"" functions. These include shutdown, log off, Standby, and Hibernate (assuming you have configured your computer for Hibernate). What this means is that my copy of this program at work starts a backup a little after my normal office hours and shuts the computer down afterwards. So I get an incremental backup of the day's complete work without spending productive office time doing it and save energy by turning it off, too. At home I have it tuck itself into Standby after our normal bed time. So we get full use of the computer all day, a backup of the day's activities afterwards, and don't let it run up our utility bill, either. And Standby turns off the USB backup drive as well to preserve its longevity.  On the other end of the spectrum you can set it to wake up your computer from Standby to run a backup before you need to use the computer.  The settings also show up in the Scheduled Tasks for Windows XP and Windows Vista (unlike any of the Ghost products). We now have four licensed copies of Genie. It is easily a better backup tool than the others we have tried: Norton Ghost 10.0, Norton Ghost 14.0, Norton 360, DT Utilities' PC Backup Pro, or the native Windows XP and Windows Vista backup programs. Genie does what you tell it to, unlike Norton Ghost which has a fit because it missed one day's scheduled incremental backup or Windows Vista's native backup which will only restore the computer to the way it was when the backup was made and therefore requires the same size hard drives partitioned into volumes exactly the same way (sort of a joke because by the time a good hard drive wears out you find they do not make them that small anymore so you can not replace it with an identical hard drive!).",0
I buy this every year and give it out to friends and family as christmas gifts since it lasts all year!,0
Excellent app.,0
"My husband and I are both running Norton Internet Security 2003 on XP systems and neither of us has had any problem with it.  When you first install this software, it guides you through the process to set it up the way you want it.  You can easily reconfigure its many different features later if you change your mind.  NIS warns you when something is accessing the internet, an excellent feature especially if you are always connected with a broadband service.  It also alerts you if there is a potential attack on your computer and automatically blocks the attack.  If there is an attack on your computer, it gives you details about the type of attack and the ISP# where the attack originated so that you can follow up if necessary.
Other features I like include ad blocking (you can block pop ups as well as many banner ads) and parental controls.  Also, you can tell Norton about important information you may keep on your computer, such as credit card numbers and account information, that you want Norton to protect and not allow to be sent out.  This comes with the antivirus software, also, so your computer is well protected.
Also, you can set Norton to auto update your antivirus and internet security features so that you are always best protected or you can choose to do it manually.  The firewall is also easy to configure to your own liking.  This software is pretty flexible and does a good job protecting my computers without having any difficulties with the XP operating system.",1

"In the beginning, there was Norton, specifically  Peter Norton who brought the world Norton Utilities in the early 80s, the first hugely successful package of PC utilities which would do wondrous things like recover accidentally deleted files. Norton AntiVirus wasn't far behind. Norton wrote books, produced utility software and in 1990 sold out to Symantec.

 Over the years Norton AntiVirus in particular became a go-to product.

 It also became bloated, buggy and slow and a lot of people, including me, migrated to more agile products.

 I have several older computers that needed to be protected, but I didn't necessarily want to spring for the price of BitDefender. So I figured I would try Norton again. After all, I could always uninstall it, which I did with several prior versions.

 This time, though, I don't think so.

 Norton, for Windows at least, is back in fighting trim. There is no physical media in the package. Just a card with a keycode. You have to go online to the Norton site to download the product. By the way, this package permits you to install the product7 on give machines, which may be Windows, Mac OS, Apple iOS or Android. I am using it only with Windows. The Apple iOS and Android offerings look weak. Also, the one-year subscription term begins with installation on the first computer, so be sure to do all the computers you plan to protect at about the same time. Ill be protecting five older Windows computers with this package.

 On n Intel i7 equipped computer, I am very pleasantly surprised so far. Installation was simple, fast and without problem. The User Interface, which at first looks way too simple, is actually quite sophisticated. Scans were very fast and efficient. Norton includes usage meters so you can clearly see how much CPU and RAM Norton is using. The impact according to the Norton meters and eyeball observation is minimal, a far cry from the last versions of Norton I used several years back.

 Overall, I am very impressed by this Norton and feel no hesitation in going ahead and installing it on another four Windows computers.

"I've used Partition Magic since version 3.0. Partition Magic 7.0 is now WinXP compatable and supports hard drives up to 80 GB.

I have a PC-DOS/Win3.1 partition and a Win98SE partition on the same hard drive and a WixXP partition (preview version) on a second hard drive. I have also had a Linux partition on the first drive. You can resize partitions and convert from fat 16 to fat32 and back. You can also divide one large hard drive into several drives to help organize data and files. Boot Magic (and the previous Boot Manager) are great to allow easy booting into any OS that you have on your drive. Partition Magic has never given my a problem. I have never lost data. The manual is clear, well written and easy to follow. If you want to have more than one OS on your computer or to try out a new OS or upgrade (like WinXP), then this program is a must have. Highly recommended.",0
"I have used Norton Antivirus since it infancy as a MS-DOS program.  I have stuck with the program because it works and works well, and with each new release it works even better.  For those who use Norton Antivirus 2003, there is little difference in the program, and perhaps the primary reason to move the newer version is the renewed subscription you will receive; the interface is the same.  Rather than radically changing the program from year to year, Symantec has made little improvements which enhance overall performance.  The results have been the consistency of a program that does the job of stopping viruses and does it well.
Installation:
Installation of Norton Antivirus 2004 is as straight forward as it is easy.  Barring any gaffes, the program will install and then ask you to register with Symantec which I recommend since this will setup the virus signature subscription program which lasts a year.
Technical Note: A virus signature is a file which contains information the antivirus program needs to defeat viruses and clean infected files.  Without updated signature files the anti-virus program would soon become outdated.  Symantec, through Live Update, continually downloads new signature files to Norton Antivirus 2004 via a subscription service which is part of the program.  However, the service lasts only a year and must be renewed-for a fee of course.
Users-like me-who also use Norton Internet Security 2003 (which shipped with Norton Antivirus 2003), will find that the program also interoperates with Norton Antivirus 2004.  During the installation process the older version will be removed and Norton Antivirus 2004 will be integrated with Internet Security 2003.
As is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be ""activated"" either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working.
Upon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.

First Impressions:
I am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program.
The sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways:
* Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.

* Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off.
* Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off.
I utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack.
Virus Scanning:
Norton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following:
* My Computer
* Scan all removable drives
* Scan all floppy disks
* Scan drives
* Scan folder
* Scan files
Custom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me!
Conclusion:
Virus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.",0
"I have had many versions of security on my PC over the years. They all pretty much do the same thing is my untrained opinion.

Of all the ones I've tried, including McAfee, Norton, AVG and some others I can't think of at the moment, this was the best. We made the mistake of taking Norton this year because we could get it for free. Free wasn't worth it. Next time, we'll be buying Kaspersky again.",0

Great interface to work with (we have tried several others). Solid software and integration with systems. Formatted working raid 5 and connected at GB speed immediately with no problems,0
"This is my second year using Kaspersky Internet Security.  This year I installed the 2011 program in April.  I originally used the program for my Dell Desktop (2.5GB Memory, 120GB Hard drive, Windows XP Pro OS) and my Dell Vostro laptop (1GB memory, 120 hard drive, Windows XP Home).  This year I also used the program for my HP Mini 210 Netbook (1GB memory, 250GB Hard drive, Windows 7 Starter).  The software installs quickly and you don't have to make a lot of decisions in using the program.  You CAN choose when to update: daily, weekly, monthly and what time of day to check for updates so it doesn't interfere with your work.  I will say that when the program is checking for updates, downloading and installing that the computer slows down quite a bit. I must add that my Internet is satellite based since I am in a rural area, however.

Since this was my first year installing the program on my netbook, I worried a bit since there is no optical drive included but right on the box the website is given for downloading the program and it was a no-brainer and very quick.

The graphic interface is cleaner and easier to use but no longer gives a list of the various parts of the program that are updated.  It still complains if your updates aren't current.

A new feature is that right on the front of the interface there is a space to drag an object to check for viruses, etc. Right there also is a Browse feature to go to the item you wish to check.

It is so convenient to have 3 licenses in one program, they all expire on the same day, however.

Amazon has a great product page for the software, listing all of the old and new features.  I am sure I am not using everything there is available as yet.  I would like to try Safe Run, which is improved this year:

""Improved--Safe Run
Provides an added layer of protection for running suspicious or unknown programs and websites. The Safe Run environment is completely walled-off from your data and PC settings, so you can ""test drive"" programs with total confidence that no harm will come to your system.""

What I like about this particular program over several others that I have used in past years is that this program runs silently in the background never ever bothering me to answer questions about what I would like done with a virus or problem it has detected.  It takes care of it by itself.  It updates silently, I can continue doing whatever it is I'm doing without being interrupted.  It does a periodic full scan and will let me know that it's doing that but I can minimize it and continue working. It's got the option of site restrictions for kids but I don't use that because it's more trouble than I like to go through.  My kids know the rules for using my computer anyway and there will be hell to pay if they break them. But others might find them useful.

"I have been using TurboTax for years and I always find it extremely easy to use and very accurate. When I have had questions I have gotten prompt replies using their forum from tax preparation professionals. You get what you pay for when it comes to tax preparation software and even though this is a bit pricey it is the best out there in my view.

My product arrived three days after expected delivery date. It turned out Amazon didn't ship it in a timely manner. Amazon offered me a promotional credit of $10 dollars which I could use on another purchase. Also, it seems FedEx Smartpost delayed it even more. Most likely due to weather issues. I feel Amazon made a reasonable solution to the shipping issue.",0

"Also, if you want to take it a step further with color and the balance of color...

This book is a great book to understand and enter into the market.  I bought the whole series and read them from cover to cover.  This is not for the advanced student, but the beginner.

I also think that fashion designers should have a thorough understanding of color theory, which is really not taught that much or well.  It is also a very complex subject to learn and understand.

  BUT!!!!!
  There is hope!!!

This book is a MUST HAVE!!!!",0
"I was looking for a way to connect multiple devices to my Yaesu FT-897 Amateur Radio. I had 3 devices that needed access to the 1 socket in the radio. (a CAT cable for computer control, a linear amplifier and an AT-897 external tuner) After switching the plugs out manually for a few weeks, I happened to see this product during a search for a multi-port switch. The price was much lower than the 2 port switch I had been considering, so I ordered it. Delivery was quite prompt and installing it to my station was easy. I'm very happy that I ran across it before ordering something less capable.",0

"I've wanted Corel Draw Graphics Suite for several years but my budget always got in the way! I purchased Corel Draw Essentials, older versions of Corel Draw, and a home and student version. None of these satisfied me! What has satisfied me is Corel Draw Graphics Suite X6. It has all the features I want. easy to navigate, and has a 300+ hard cover guidebook! Since I am familiar with earlier versions of CorelDraw, I haven't had occasion to use the manual (yet)... but what I did discover about the manual is that offers a lot of ideas for the tools that are part of CorelDraw and I probably would overlook the possibilities. This is a first-class graphics suite in every way and inclues not only CorelDraw X6 but also Photo-Paint, Power-Trace, Website Creator, Corel Capture, and more. I like Photo-Paint, a professional photo editing application. If someone asked me if this is worth $500, I'd certainly say, ""Yes!"". Believe me, you'll get your money's worth with this edtion of CorelDraw. Additionally, there are 1,000 professional Open Type fonts, thousands of photos, images, and templates. There's also a two-hour training video to supplement the manual! CorelDraw Graphics Suite X6 functions as smooth as silk! Highly recommended.",0
"It was bad enough when Quicken simply littered your desktop with icons linking to Quicken Loans, Free Credit Reports (which are never free) and a sundry of other financial pay-to-play products. Now they've taken things to a whole new level with ads literally BUILT INTO the GUI (Graphic User Interface: the 'skin' with which you engage with the program). An example: in the new 'refinance calculator' there is a large banner ad for CHASE BANK. The refinance calculator itself is poor and majorly inferior to free ones available online, but more on that later. I don't expect to pay upwards of $50.00 for a piece of software that contains banner ads! That is simply unacceptable. In freeware, I understand it, but not in something I paid full retail for!

Adding insult to injury, INTUIT has actually removed one of the best features of previous Quicken releases, the CASH FLOW monthly chart. They've replaced it with a projected balances chart which is ugly, harder to read, and doesn't convey nearly as much information as the previous version. A line chart is inferior for the purpose, and INTUIT hasn't even managed to make the data points (low and high balance points along the chart) display the actual balance when you mouse over them. This is a miserably bad design--they've managed to take a very useful tool and turn it into garbage.

The supposed new features are junk. The refinance calculator is extremely simplistic compared to far better online versions (check out Equitrend Financial Calculators if you're looking for sophisticated, free calculators). It doesn't allow the user to enter current mortgage interest rate or PMI, and instead makes you enter the total payment and then the ""impound / escrow amount."" If you have your mortgage set-up to be tracked in Quicken, the tool cannot incorporate that data into your analysis. You must manually enter everything. The tool also does not take into account the tax implications of your refinance. Overall it is a tacked on, basic calculator that is nearly useless.

The obligatory re-skin of the program (which INTUIT trots out each year rather than making substantial or meaningful changes) is adequate, but unnecessary. Every year they tweak fonts, colors, and layout, and design elements. This year is no exception. None of the changes make the program more efficient for the end user. I don't have a problem with utilitarian designs, as long as the underlying software is substantial. INTUIT seems to leverage much of their development budget into GUI tweaks, while doing little to improve the software itself.

Another major issue is that INTUIT cannot manage to keep their data file consistent from year to year. 2011 is no exception and required me to convert my 2010 data file. Admittedly this was much more painless than the massive difficulty many experienced with upgrading from 2008 or 2009 to 2010. I wish that the developers at INTUIT would make a forwards compatible data file type and just stick with it.

SUMMARY:

PROS:

1) Potentially better GUI (depending on your preferences)

CONS:

1) Ads built into the GUI itself

2) Removal of a significant feature (cash flow and balance chart)

3) No substantial improvements to the underlying programs

4) Added 'features' are poor quality, even when compared with free alternatives

5) Requires yet another data-file conversion

6) Expensive! Especially considering the ads built into the program

FINAL THOUGHTS:

What am I getting for my money here? If you love this version of Quicken, can you kindly explain to me why it is worth upgrading? I have yet to find a single compelling reason. Am I missing something or did I just flush my money down the toilet?",1

"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC.
Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.",0

"Cyberlink PowerDirector 13 Ultimate

Let me start out by saying there are many high quality Video Editing software out there that offer a lot of high tech effects, lots features that take many weeks or months of continue use to master, but one of the most important features to me must be that Ease of Use feature.

I don't have a degree in video editing, I just want a fairly simple program that offers many features that don't require vast knowledge of rocket science to operate. In this Cyberlink PowerDirector, I think I found one.

The process is simple and to the point, Capture, Edit, Produce and Create a Disk. This program was the simplest I've ever was able to capture video without a bunch of hoopla, especially from my Canon VIXTA Mini X. Once captured, editing was easy so far as all I wanted to do was clean up my video of my new grandchildren, edit out the different pauses and rearrange some of the sequences before copying to several disks to share with other family members.

Another feature was how easy it was to change the format and how quickly the Rendering process was. You know, isn't the usual long time it takes for a project to render a real deal breaker. This program is three times as fast as the others I've used and own.

And because this is the Ultimate version, it came with several add-ons that offer many different approaches to video editing like CyberLinks newest version of WaveEditor 2 for that awesome sound effects, Holiday and Wedding effects and what seems to be an endless array of special effects and adjustments. And although having the ability to view actual 4K is limited and still priced very high, this software has you covered for that also.

Am I an expert using CyberLink's newest video editing software, not quite, but so far I am finding it to be the easiest software of this type to master. Along with my new video camera, his software and the several holidays just around the corner, I am looking forward to making some awesome videos.",0

"I have been using Quicken, in  its various iterations, for several years now. I am by no means a power user. I basically use Quicken as an over glorified checkbook, and it has been an excellent program for my purposes. I started using Quicken when I had a free basic version on my first computer, a Packard Bell. Generally, as a rule I upgrade to the next version every two or three years, however, when I was offered an upgrade to 2013 on the Amazon Vine program my interest was piqued. The main reason I went with the upgrade was for Quicken mobile. The main program pretty much operates the way all my other Quicken programs have in the past, virtually the same interface, same functions, same tools. The main difference that I have found is in the search feature is a little different but not too daunting. Now on to the main reason I upgraded to 2013..... The Quicken mobile. I now have it installed on my iPhone and Kindle fire. I have yet to delve into all its intricacies and is trying to figure out how it works. There is a learning curve, but in all honesty, if I cannot figure out the Quicken mobile part of it. I am no further behind than when I started, it's the same great Quicken program. As I stated before, I mainly use it as an over glorified checkbook and that excels in that regards. The other part of Quicken that I rely heavily on is the bill pay service. This works so much better than the old-fashioned way..... Getting a bill in the mail, opening the envelope, writing a check, attaching a stamp, and going to the post office to mail it. Now I get all my bills online (except for a couple of Luddites), and do all my bill paying via Quicken 2013. When I am on the road for a couple of weeks at a time I take my laptop computer with my Quicken program. That way if I need to pay any bills it is not a problem. As I have stated previously, I am not a power user of the Quicken program. I do not use budgeting, account management (except for my bank accounts), investment tracking, etc. For those that want a more robust financial program with all the bells and whistles, this is it. I am by no means a computer or financial wizard, just a truck driver looking for a better way to manage his finances, and Quicken 2013 fills the bill in that department. As far as the upgrade from 2012, as I have mentioned, the main reason I went with 2013 was for the Quicken mobile, and I am sure once I get a chance to play with that feature I will make better use of the new version.",0

"I love the features this offers.  I can sync my itouch with my mac without even docking it.  my calendar, addressbook and email are all automatically updated.  it also updates pictures. it does this all through push technology.  with itouch you have to be in a wifi spot to sync without docking.  with iphone you just have to be where you get service.  also, all information is on web so you can look it up from any computer if you forget your itouch.  had i known about this, i probably would have saved the money on my blackberry and just kept a regular cell phone and then purchased this for my itouch.  blackberry's have lots of problems syncing with macs so i am very excited about this program because i can keep my information with me on my itouch.

i forgot to add that this keeps my multiple mac laptops synced with each other without me having to do anything.

I have used this product for almost a year now.  I purchased it again to renew it as it is cheaper usually to do that through amazon.  One thing to remember is that if you catch it at a good price, you can renew anytime during your membership and it will add another year to your membership--even if you are only 1 day in.  I know some people that bought 5 and have 5 years worth--there doesn't seem to be a limit to how long apple will let you pay in advance.

It actually is considered a 2000 upgrate -- from 5.0 to 5.1 -- but the feature changes are more dramatic and should warrant a 5.5 or 6.0.

Planned routes can be searched for places or points of interests along the way within specified distances, and MapPoint will display an easy-to-follow proximity-highlighted readout of the results complete with extended information. You can easily expand or contract the distance criterea as well.

"There may be some people out there that don't like QuickBooks, but I'm not one of them. Perhaps because my needs aren't as robust, but I don't experience any of the problems I've read about.

One thing off the bat: the QB methodology is way more intuitive to non-accounts than any other program I've used, which for me is a good thing: I'm not an accountant. Invoices, purchase orders, credits, payments etc are all easily entered and, more importantly, modified if need-be. I remember using a more traditionally set-up accounting program in the past and some of those operations were almost impossible to figure out (though as I said, for real accountants those programs may be more intuitive, and QB more frustrating).

Frankly, I haven't run into any problems that I couldn't figure out myself, and I've been able to get the program up and running exactly as I want it to run, quickly and easily. Any errors I've run into at all were quickly rectified by doing a database rebuild, so I've been quite happy.  Add to that the utter confusion I experienced using competing products and there's nothing out there that I'd rather use.

It may not be the be-all and end-all if you're an accountant, but I've yet to find anything that I want to do with it that I can't, and it's done everything I've asked without a hiccup. Considering what I used to pay my accountants in New York every month, this is a total winner.",0
"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error my executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This H&R Block Deluxe includes only the federal tax return (no State).  This version entitles a person to 5 free federal e-files.  The program allows to print any number of returns without limits, and if you decide to mail returns (instead of e-filing) there no additional fees.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 Adding this point based on a useful question in the comments:  The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"Hello, Says it can make my laptop run faster. I tried it and it did. It claims it is easy to use. Yes, it is easy to use. It claims it won't make a mess of my laptop. Right again.

UPDATE I installed this on my 64bit OS and soon received a message from the developer informing me that I need to discontinue Win cleaner on the 64bit OS. Due to reports of inflicting damage to the OS. I've been attributing the 64bit OS problems to MS updater loading the AMD 64 drivers on to my desktop w/Intel processor. Side Note...MS is really getting to be pain in my butt! UPDATE Wincleaner is a type of software that gets well...stolen. My KAV burned me and I in the end nuke the drive. I asked the software developer if I could have another shot at loading the software because unlike modern software that has the ability to recognize that it is back on the same computer (FAIR USE CLAWS) this software will not recognize the fact the it's reinstalled on the same computer. I call that stealing back the product.",0

"I'll admit, I've been running Windows 7 for six months now: the preproduction version of it and have just upgraded to the gold code.  So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system.  Let's get to the nitty gritty:

Should you upgrade from Windows Vista?  YES!  I mean it - upgrade today.
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.  Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2.

Should you upgrade from Windows XP? Maybe, but for different reasons.
XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good.  However, XP is old as an operating system.  Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7.  That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system.

64 bit or 32 bit?
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section.  If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better.  If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now.

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
I recommend you have:
-a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine
-4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market)
-good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50)
-back up your files to a USB drive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-My-Passport-Essential-500-GB-USB-2-0-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-WDME5000TN-Midnight-Black/dp/B001F9LY14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black)</a>

-check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7

INSTALLATION:
Installation was very straight forward.  You put in the CD and reboot your machine.  You might have to enter your bios and enable the ""boot from CD"" option.  Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation.  You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation.  I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system.  It worked great.
The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider.
I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should  help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition.  I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front.  That said, I recently upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-CP2025DN-Color-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B001F0RI1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer</a>&nbsp;that I love so no real loss there.  I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print.  Everything else upgraded.

BENEFITS
-faster boot time
-faster go to sleep
-faster wakeup
-faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond)
-joining wireless networks is much easier
-the interface is just plain beautiful
-my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture)
-Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop.  I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me
-Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running
-Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data.  It's great!  I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files!
-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love.
-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-3User-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010</a>. Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but

CONS:
- Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver.
- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS.

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET?
I got the ultimate version because I have clients who ask, ""is your hard drive encrypted?"" -- I wanted to be able to say yes and have sensitive data encrypted one of my computer volumes - Bitlocker is only available in the Ultimate version.  Ultimate also includes Multilanguage support.

If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition.  If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining.  Also Windows Professional gives you the option to run applications in XP mode so if you have old applications you can use that nifty feature.  I already have 1 application running in XP mode - it's nifty to run an old application.

NOTE:
The box contains both the 32 bit and 64 bit OS.

OVERALL:
It's very hard to write a comprehensive review on an entire operating system so I didn't even try - I'm sure magazines will devote entire articles to the operating system and several books will come out.  My goal here is just to give everyone a glimpse of what I've found to date with this new OS. I do hope this has helped you in making a decision.

Hats off to Microsoft on Windows 7.  It's more of a refined Windows Vista than an entirely new operating system but it was needed.  Thank you.",0

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 version were resolved in this X4 version.  It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 A very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace.  You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software.  This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices.  If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5.  Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own.  As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.  I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.

The PaintShop Pro X4 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down.  With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10.  PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.  The rich set of tools included in PaintShop Pro range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the new ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.  This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects.  Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.  To help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.  One thing that I noticed was that the dialog box window for the 'Effect Browser' has not been updated to match the stylish new user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PaintShop Pro versions.

 The new HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools.  HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure.  There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing.  For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing.  On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating.  Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix.  In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at.  If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results.  But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots.  Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene.  This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output.  I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people.  HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at.  Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described.  So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo.  This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well.  As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.  When I mentioned above that Photomatix lets me specifically define and select the original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for people's faces, I can simulate this function in PaintShop Pro by using this new ""Photo Blend"" tool on the saved file output after using the ""Exposure Merge"" tool, but this workflow is very cumbersome and tedious.

 The new ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas.  This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 Although adding a vignette effect was present in previous PaintShop Pro versions, this has now been expanded into a separate tool with more flexible options.

 A new ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo.  These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 More than 20 tools have been upgraded to support 16-bit images.

 There is built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"".  The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos.  This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files.  Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos.  The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools.  Edits can also be applied to batches of files.  This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab.  Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work.  By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab.  I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools.  If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab.  The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top.  Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools.  And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'.  The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab.  One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool.  But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'.  Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are.  At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option.  Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials.  As with some of their other recent software releases, Corel has the help documentation in this PaintShop Pro X4 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched.  I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site.  After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access.  On September 2011, Corel released a 125-MB 'Corel_PSPX4_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on my computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new tab to display Corel's online help content.  And there does not seem to be a way to configure PaintShop Pro X4 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available.  But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed.  The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If, like me, your PaintShop pro install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files.  This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability.  During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook.  Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer.  When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This new X4 version of PaintShop Pro now requires only 1GB of disk space.  The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized.  So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required.  By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 10, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program!

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of.  If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free.  And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance.  In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.  But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go.  Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative.  If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4.  And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a previous version of PaintShop Pro, is this PaintShop Pro X4 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely!  As previously mentioned, if version X4's one main new feature was the addition of HDR tools, I would say to just keep your existing X3 version and purchase Photomatix for your HDR needs since Photomatix is far better at HDR processing than what Corel, or Adobe, has as their HDR offering.  But there are at least 75 new and enhanced features with version X4, and if you can purchase it aggressively discounted on Amazon, this is a must-buy upgrade.  Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 runs a lot faster and more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PaintShop Pro X4 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>?

I feel that PaintShop Pro X4 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 10.  PSPX4 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE10.  APE10 includes more built-in layer styles that PSPX4 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this.  Once you become proficient in PSPX4, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse.  Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PaintShop Pro, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem.  APE10 has more adjustment brushes than PSPX4 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation.  But PSPX4 has more artistic tools than APE10, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSPX4 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE10.  PSPX4 requires less than half the disk space to install than APE10, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE10, even though PSPX4 is far more packed with features.  But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE10 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSPX4.

One final note:

Two of the extras that are included in this ""Ultimate"" bundle are couple codes that allow you to download 21 photos from Fotolia and receive a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  However, these coupon codes have expiration dates on them, and on the package that I received, the offers are only valid through December 31 2012.  I do not know if this expiration date applies to the coupon codes of all ""Ultimate"" packages that are shipped throughout 2012 or if Corel adjusts the expiration dates for packages that are shipped out later, but that is something to consider if you are deciding to purchase this near the end of 2012.

Also, during the past 8 months, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for this PaintShop Pro X4.  After installing PaintShop Pro on your computer, you can either download these large 235-MB executables from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",0
"Quick Books is justly popular. Not only will it help you keep the books, but it also captures quite a lot of data. You'll have the info you need for billing, for determining the level of profitability of your jobs, and for managing contractors as well as employees.

It's easy to install and easy enough to figure out, but you'll be more successful (if you don't have a background in accounting) if you pick up an instruction book. The documentation that comes with the program isn't nearly enough.",0
"I was amazed at how quickly the software installs & updates.

I installed WinCleaner on a PC that I had previously used and then uninstalled Norton Systemworks. When I ran WinCleaner the first time it found a bunch of stuff to clean and correct. After doing all that, the computer was noticeably faster responding!

I don't know if the Systemworks was badly bogging down my computer (even though I kept Norton Antivirus 2009 installed) or if it was the clean-ups and registry stuff it did. But in any case it did the job!

I installed it on a PC with Windows Vista SP2 and on a PC with XP - Both work fine!

You can set it up so that when it cleans out the ""internet junk files"" it actually wipes these files. If you're paranoid about credit card info and so forth - That's a good thing!

WinCleaner you have slain Norton Systemworks! And I used Systemworks for about 10 years. Thank you!",0
"Being a long time (17 years) user of Chief Architect Inc software, all versions I never tire of singing its praises. It is really magical how, in just a few moments you can create virtual spaces and instantly see them from any angle. The first time I installed my first program in just a few minutes after that I was able to create accurate, dimensioned floor plans and then instantly being able to view the results, print the scaled results and close a remodeling job quickly. With each version it just gets better and better.

The point is communication, graphic communication for yourself as the designer and to communicate your designs to Building Professionals who will help you bring this ""dream"" of yours to a physical reality and accomplishment, now that is Magic!

Another thing to know is that this is not light-weight software, it may have a light-weight price but it is very capable and demanding software on your PC. What I Mean is it requires an above average PC for it to run well, the main point of weakness in most average PC's is the video card or the lack of one (where the video is built into the mother board) called integrated video. This will not give you good, enjoyable performance for any graphic-heavy work, like 3-D modeling. You need a dedicated, separate video card with at least 512Mb of RAM built into the video card to support what you can do using Home Designer software.

I needed to upgrade in order to prepare to go back to school.  So far I still have to learn a lot more about the software so I have to get the book.  I would recommend this to those that have at least an intermediate level of computer knowledge - this is definitely not for novice computer users.,0

Norton Antivirus 2014 is a fantastic program. I've been using Norton off and on for a good many years. I strayed away from it for awhile because their programs took up too much RAM and bogged the computer down. In the past couple of years Norton has seemed to fix this problem and it runs in the background on my older Windows 7 computer with no problems. Norton seems to catch some of the stuff that other antivirus programs may miss. I've never had a problem with my computer becoming infected with a virus while using Norton. I also love the fact that I can buy it once and put it on all 3 computers in my house. Just one note with that though is that the 365 days of protection start from the first day you install it on the first computer.,0

"It has been said that the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is caused from a perceived disconnection from the Divine--either within oneself or in the universe at large.

We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.

Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.

In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.

Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:

*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video

*More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""

*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh

*Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors

*""Light Stone"" energy translator

*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences

*Original Soul Flight music CD

*Companion Guide and User's Manual

The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.

The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

"The very first time I played this game (waaay back when it was first released), I found myself incapable of finishing it because I was just too scared. Please, if anyone scares easily, know this: This is not a scary game. It has it's wonderful spook elements, but the game overall isn't terrifying. It's actually really beautiful. Especially when you start getting near to the end.

To people looking to buy: There is an interesting historical level, the characters are all interesting, the setting is gorgeous (though now you can really tell that the graphics are dated, but that's ok), and all the loose ends are tied up. Also, you really get an interesting look into the past with this game.

I would not suggest this for people who get bored easily or are impatient because this game does take a bit of digging, and, as the title of this review states, it's not the most riveting game out there. You are stuck out on Moon Lake, which has a very small population of three people and you at this point. But it does have a lot of places to unlock, which is something I like in my games (finding new areas as the game progresses, rather than everything being handed to you upfront). Not that games that don't have secret passages aren't as good, they can be great too. I just get a little tingly 'I'm an adventurer' feeling when I find places that no one has seen in decades (or centuries, in some games). It's those little moments that make this such a great game.",0
"Honestly, I believe that all AV software is pretty good at providing protection. I have four PC's and I run different AV software on all of them.  Mostly because I get free versions to review.  As of right now I am using McAfee, AVG, Viper and TrendMicro and they all work well.

What I like best about TrendMicro is that is stays out of the way (does not take up too many resources) and it installs and un-installs easily.

I wrestled with Norton and vowed to never, ever use them again. It simply took over my PC and it took forever to scrub it off my system; not so with TrendMicro; it runs very cleanly.

Very nice, great protection and easy on the system.  That's all I want out of a AV package.

PS - it would be nice if this included a Firewall, but that is why we have Comodo!",0

"Kaspersky is a well recognized name in computer security, they are one of the top computer / internet security companies in the world.

While Android is fairly safe without any security product, that is you actually have to install the rogue virus or spyware yourself, it does a good job at keeping the careless user better protected. I've not noticed any decrease in system performance, and my abysmal battery life hasn't been affected in any noticeable manner either. Before installing this product, I could get an average of 8 hours use on one battery charge, and with this installed and doing it's thing, I still get an average of 8 hours.

"I've been running Norton on my desktop for the past few years. I thought I would try this and see if I like it better. It does seem to use less resources and seems to pick up malware well. It doesn't quite have the bells and whistles that I have with the Norton. I can't get too technical on this review because I'm not a tech wiz, but it seems like McAfee runs smoother and doesn't slow down my computer as much as Norton does when it's running. I never got a virus while using Norton 360, so it'll be interesting to see how well McAfee protects me compared to Norton. So far I like it.",0
"I ordered WinZip 17 to compress files for storage, mainly video files. We also need it to unzip files that people send us via email. We also plan to use it to encrypt files.

WinZip 17 was simple to install. We immediately began using it without reading any instructions.

The file compression speed is fast although even with our year old computer it hogs the system while compressing, meaning, you can't do much else with the computer when it is compressing. However the compression speed is fast so we just don't multitask during that procedure.

I rate this software 5 stars = I Love It for its ease of use and fast compression speed.",0

"If you are looking for something to take you to the next level with your new pen tablet, this is the perfect choice.  There are several software options with a lot of extras and even more to learn.  However, here you have a a function that just works smoothly, without fear of complexity, and you are creating as soon as you start the program.

I have a Mac and a PC.  The PC being a bit older and the iMac within the past year.  This works just as well on both, but I am preferring the Mac.  I also have two pen tablet from Wacom... the easy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bamboo-Fun-Tablet/dp/B000V9RL6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bamboo Fun Tablet</a>&nbsp;and the omg version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-Intuos4-Tablet/dp/B001TUYTZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom Intuos4 Tablet</a>.  The combo of my Mac, SketchBook Pro 2010, and my  Intuos4 is quite a fascinating creative outlet.

You don't need to have a pen tablet for this software, but as soon as you try this, you will get one.  There is not much to learn here.  You install, and it gives you the widest screen possible to paint, sketch, edit, write, and just have fun.  Even at the retail price, this is quite the bargain.  Compared to some other software options out there, this is the place to begin.  Work your way up to something more advanced later on, but this is quite advanced for my use.

My favorite part about this is that I feel like I am going back to something that I have neglected for years, and that is pen and ink drawing.  I was avidly creating very detailed work to the point of looking like photographs.  It's partly due to my slight OCD, but all that matters is that I must be able to control the detail.  Never in a million years would I have thought I could do this on my computer.  I actually feel reunited with my Rapidograph pen I used in College.

There are other functions here that go beyond art, as you can edit scanned photos, blueprints, layouts, touch up, repair, alterations of previous works, etc..  Even if you were to buy this for photo editing alone, it's worth the investment.  The memory functions are a plus as you can create little snippets of your work, and add them to something else.  One thing I could think of that would be useful for is interior design.  i.e. create a couch, and add the couch to any work, or duplicate it etc.  I look forward to expanding my personal creativity as I continue to find the benefits of this software.",0

"This edition of Windows XP is primarily business oriented, but there are certain features that would be useful in the Home Edition of Windows XP. Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is ""awesome"", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The ""start menu"", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the ""start menu"" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, ""ME"" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. ""KODAK"". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home.

"WordPerfect Office X7 Home and Student is an excellent software and contains just about everything one needs for creating great presentations on your computer or simple word processing!

Office X7 has many new tools and features. It allows you create professional quality documents with the legendary Word Perfect as well as spreadsheets. I am very amazed with what can be done with Presentations.

The software is also compatible with over sixty different file types which can really come in handy. Another awesome feature is the PDF abilities it has. Corel bills it as, ""the first PDF office suite,"" and I think they might be right. It allows for you to Import, Edit and  Export PDF files rather easily and I like this feature very much. You can even make your own fillable PDF forms!

Since I'm rather new to WordPerfect software not having used it for years I also found the built-in Help references very very useful and helpful. There are many new and extra features so people who are familiar and not so familiar with former versions of WordPerfect will have many things to discover about this really cool software.",0

"Everyone doing drafting today is familiar with AutoCAD. It is so widely used that there are now several alternate use models for which AutoCAD itself is overkill. AutoCAD LT 2012 perfectly fits several of these, take a look:

Home/Laptop/Travel/Sales Office/Customer Meetings: I keep a copy of LT on my laptop for use at customer meetings and even the work site.  Cheaper than AutoCAD, with perfect compatibility. There's no better way to review and modify drawings in the field (except AutoCAD). I know of one contractor who keeps a laptop loaded with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-LT-2010/dp/B001UO8M8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD LT 2010</a>&nbsp;on loan with his biggest customer. They can view anything, make changes, and in general work together better.

2D Drafting: AutoCAD LT 2012 is all you need. There is nothing a 2D draftsman needs that this package does not offer. Note however, none of AutoCAD's 3D capabilities are included.

As successful as this low-end product has become, it has one flaw: it retains the steep learning curve of its big brother. I am of two minds here. As a powerful stand-alone 2D package, AutoCAD LT 2012 has a depth of capability that few will use completely. That depth deserves some learning (or better yet, professional training). Makers of other high end packages have successfully built low-end tools that are easier to learn: Adobe Photoshop Elements comes to mind. But Elements provides only a small subset of the functionality of Photoshop, unlike AutoCAD LT 2012, which provides virtually the entire AutoCAD feature set (except 3D).

So if you need a 2D drafting package with flawless AutoCAD compatibility, AutoCAD LT 2012 is literally perfect. But if you don't use AutoCAD already, you will need training, or at the very least a good book!",0
Kapersky is contantly ranked in the top tier for antivirus solutions. Tom's Guide currently ranks it #2. I know I've never had a problem with infections on any machine running Kapersky. It's a lot cheap than havign to wipe your computer or have it disinfected too.,0
"I've always used Open Office on my Macintosh, and for most things Open Office does just fine.  However, my wife, being a teacher, often has to prepare power point presentations and edit other teachers word documents. While open office does a nice job, you just can't beat the real thing for compatability with the ""Windows World"".  Everything looks nearly the same as the windows computers she is used to, and power point presentations display exactly as we expect them to when used on Windows Power point.  So far has been very stable and responsive.",0

"I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.  Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses ""screen real-estate"" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.
However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.
And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.  The backup feature is excellent as well!!
My hats off to Microsoft for another great product!!",0

"in broad terms, legal business Pro 2014, provides you with a framework and structure for you to hang your knowledge upon. I would not suggest that you rely upon this extensive library of contracts and forms if you have absolutely no knowledge of the law, or no experience with legal issues. That being said it is a first-class tool to use at state and federal level. The program itself is extraordinarily easy to install. The user agreement in the installation process is mildly amusing since it disavows any liability and
recommends that you should consult a lawyer, and the extent of any liability for the company that puts out the legal business Pro software is just for the cost of the program. That piece of mild amusement (at least for anyone who has done contract law at university level) aside, the program provides updates as you start and continues, if you register, to provide additional updates for two years after 31st of December 2014; one of the bonuses of registration is a 404 page contract law book.
  Once you start the program you have a whole list of resources including a library of legal books and even references to lawyers by category. When you start to create a document the program has a basic three-part interface: the first is create document. The second is read Nolo book from library. And the third is view checklist. A sizable amount of the forms that you can use are basically fill in the spaces type of documents, and for small businesses these will undoubtedly come in handy; about the only recommendation I would make is that wherever possible make sure that you have very good records, since (for example) a request for a bounced check to be honored, could quickly get to a small claims issue, and how something as simple as that is handled varies from state to state. The second reference to the library is probably going to be good for research for contracts, and finding cases with precedents where certain clauses are deemed enforceable, and certain closely worded ones are deemed not enforceable can usually be found in either case law or precedent books. In the more basic sense, the checklist in legal business Pro can help you through some easy things to sort out, as well as some moderately complex things to sort out. As good as this set of forms, contracts, and other references are in the legal realm, the biggest issue you will face, in my opinion, is the decision concerning when your own ability to handle issues is stretched to its limits, and it's time to call a lawyer. Still, it may be a big learning experience if you draft up a contract, whether agreement, lease, business related contract, and take it to a lawyer and see how far off the mark you might be. If you are halfway decent at researching you might actually find that you can draw up a contract that actually stands up to the test, and legal business Pro 2014 is definitely the set of tools to get you at least part of the way there.",0

"Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.

As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.

So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).

And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.

Now, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.",0
Great value. Taxes done quickly and accurately.  I've used H&R tax software for years.,0
"This is WAAAAY cheaper than buying it directly from Norton. Just keep in mind that you will lose any remaining days you have left if you are upgrading, so be sure to wait until just before it's about to expire. If you already have this and are just renewing, you don't have to install anything. Just click on ""renew"" at the bottom of your Norton window until you get to the screen that says something like ""I have a keycode"" and just enter the keycode you got in your email when you bought this.",0
"I received this program through the Amazon Vine program. It came with a license to use it on three computers. My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.

All the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.

Even using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.

I had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.

The long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.

Also when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.

We were so happy to uninstall this from all of our computers. Now are computers are back to normal.

We did spend quite a lot of time installing this program and then uninstalling it. What a waste of time this was. I can't believe how poor this program is, I'm really surprised.

If I had paid money for this I'd be irate about it! I got it free from the Amazon Vine program so all that was wasted was our time.",1
"As a person who loves doing alotta online shopping specially during our christmas season which is coming up as you can find stuff on line you can't locally. Well its important to me where i shop and how secure the transactions are. whats nice about this is it can be incorporated into firefox as well as IE. It will show a green color if the site is good safe . it will turn yellow as a warning/neutral, It will be grey if it is a site which hasn't been tested yet and red for a site thats completely unsafe and bad known to send tons of spam /phishing etc.  A good point too about t his is you can click on check  it and view site report and read bout what alotta other people have noticed about a particular site etc and other opinions. Here is a trick if you wanna see it in action and how it works. type in any search engine ""free wii"" don't we all who  own one wish it was that easy to find  haha. Anyhow you will come up with all those lovely sites that insist you do some work for them before you get the product if you ever do but you end up getting tons of spam and ripped off in the end. Anyhow this is a good way to test out site advisor most of those sites are in the ""RED""zone which show they are bad and bogus .I love having this on my computer it keeps me from unsafe websites and keeps my online shopping experiences a pleasant one ,keep spam down to a minimum.

"I prefer Trend Micro to MacAfee, Norton and other protection software. After years of fighting with protection software, it was a pleasure to use Trend Micro, which provides me the security I need without the compatibility headaches so common with this type of software.

Trend Micro AntiVirus + AntiSpyware allows you to send and receive email and share files with protection from malicious viruses, Trojan horse programs, and spyware. This product does not provide Internet security. For full protection, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trend-Micro-Internet-Security-Pro-3-0/dp/B002EAYJEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trend Micro Internet Security Pro 3.0</a>.

For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I look for three things:

1. Easy to install and easy to use
2. Operates without slowing down my laptop
3. The software works; viruses and spyware are stopped before they cause trouble.

Trend Micro meets all of those expectations.

Too often, consumers confuse the basic protection packages with the ""Pro"" versions.

"Installed perfectly on Windows XP. Imported last years tax data perfectly.

Manually downloaded information from all my financial institutions, using the correct import file that the firms make available for manual import. (Not the import button in Turbo Tax)

IMPORTANT!  Remember to get the correct file from your broker since the import function button in Turbo Tax does not import your cost basis for stock or options. Unless you do, you will have to fill this out yourself.  Talk about time, and time is money..Get the right file!

I find that there really is no need to buy the more expensive version, this product does schedule C for my business and home office. I used the Home and Business last year and quite frankly found very little difference in the product. Annoyingly, Turbo Tax kept asking me to upgrade.

This year I knew that e-filing would cost and I gladly paid for it since I was afraid of the IRS's human/scan error in transcribing and I only paid $29 for Turbo Tax with State this year from Amazon.

Received my State Refund in a week, and I my Federal Refund in 2 weeks. No extra costs, deposited right into my bank account.

I still use the forms function to fill in most information, since that is quickest.

ItsDeductable software is useless, time consuming and I question the high amounts it gives to used, very good condition clothing. For my purposes, I claim 10% of the new purchase price for a deduction. If a suit cost $125, the donation is $12.50. Come on guys, I've worn the suit--How can it be worth $65? Maybe this is why Turbo Tax sells extra audit protection?  Since I did not pay for ITsDeductable, I still give Turbo Tax Five Stars this year.

"This remains an outstanding trip planning and GPS program.  Unfortunately, some of the map details are still not as good as were found in the 2004 version of this program. I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simplifying which only serves to confuse.

Despite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better more affordable solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook computer.  Even if you have an ""all in one"" solution such as the Garmin Nuvi Streets and Trips can help you plan your trip and routs.  I have both and they compliment one another very well.

A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.

I heartily recommend this product!  The updated mapping details and new points of interest are also useful.",0

"I've been using Painter since version 4, back when Fractal Design was still behind it. It's always been THE app for artists who want to recreate the look of natural media within the digital space. I was delighted when I received this new version to review.

Over the years, Painter has been moving toward a close compatibility with Photoshop. Not only can you import/export Painter files to Photoshop, but the GUI has also moved from a more idiosyncratic one to one that mirrors the thinking behind PSD. And Painter's natural-media library is so extensive, the app is now beyond compare -- there isn't another app out there that really competes in terms of media replication.

I still use Photoshop and Painter for my digital art. Both apps have their strengths, and Corel has done a great job of ensuring an almost seamless workflow twixt the two apps. Photoshop can be used to make great digital art, especially if you're pretty good with creating brushes, using blend modes and creating texture overlays. But it can't beat Painter for mimicking natural media at a basic ""stroke"" level. If you want your digital work to look like watercolors, pastels, oils, etc., that have been rendered ""by hand,"" Painter is the tool for you.

By the way, if your art mainly consists of pencil and/or pen work, the much cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autodesk-SketchBook-Pro-7-Download/dp/B00LH6ZWIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7 [Download</a>] is a great option for that. I've used and reviewed SketchBook in the past, and it's great for line work and broad color overlays/fill-ins. I don't use SketchBook  that often because 1) I already own Painter and it does the line work just as well as SketchBook and 2) Painter's coloring and paint-modeling options are greater than Sketchbook's. But if you don't need the extensive range of natural-media effects Painter offers and you're basically looking for a very good sketch app, keep SketchBook in mind.

BTW, I use a Wacom with Painter and I should mention a tablet greatly aids in the natural media reproduction. That being said, I have used a mouse for Painter and still gotten very good results. But if you get Painter and you're serious about taking advantage of all it can deliver, you'll probably want to invest in a graphics tablet at some point. So figure in the cost of that when you purchase this program. (Even a less-expensive tablet will greatly improve the look of your strokes within the app.)

SUMMARY: Painter is not a cheap app, so if you just need an app that will allow you to create line work and/or very flat artwork, Photoshop and SketchBook will work for you. But if you're an artist looking to recreate natural media to a pretty amazing degree, Painter is worth the money. Nothing else currently available can best this app at what this app sets out to do.",0
"Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon"").

"It's been a long time. I am at least a few years behind on upgrades. I really haven't had any reason to do so up until now. I recently had been concerned about my old software working correctly with Windows 8.1, which I moved to, and also with the coming of Windows 10. This was a very reasonable offer that motivated me to migrate from OmniPage 15 to 18. I like OmniPage very much. I have been using it for much more than a decade. I have tried other OCR software, but I believe that I am spoiled by OmniPage. Their new editions, however, are very expensive--better put: cost-prohibitive--and provide little new functionality as far as I am concerned in proportion to the money that is spent. This edition installs and seems to work well on Windows 8.1. It registered quickly with the given Serial Number, Activated flawlessly, and so I am satisfied. I knew eventually I would have to upgrade to newer software, but was hanging on waiting for an opportunity like this to come. Hopefully, it will allow me to be able to seek another reasonably priced upgrade in the future, but as you can see, I am not in a hurry to spend more money on this!",0
"I am again sourly disappointed with the installation process, tech support and licensing hassles of PaperPort 14.  This install was an upgrade from PP12 because it had been reinstalled too many times, causing blockage by Nuance.  I could have called them again but it was time to get the latest version.

I am a home user, who started with PagesPro then a Xerox product.  I like the product, particularly the image printing to PDF and the PDF editing features.  I use them regularly.

Unfortunately, with this edition, after a clean re-install of WIN7 Pro 64-bit the image printer driver refused to install -- the main program installed fine.  I called Nuance support, no 800 number available, was on hold forever and the best they could do was say try reinstalling with the firewall and anti-virus disabled.  That made no sense, the main program was installed and registered.

My  problem was with the printer driver install only.  There are a lot of us with that problem.  I read their posts.  I tried many workarounds with no meaningful help from Nuance.  Finally, I found a utility in the image printer driver's program folder for reinstalling the printer driver after an OS upgrade -  WORKED LIKE A CHAMP. To bad Nuance did not know enough to tell me to try it.

ALSO, there is a known bug in the standard version of PP14's update program.  It does not report any update!  There are many workarounds on the web for that as well, however, none worked for me.  I am yet to call Nuance for their ""help"" with this known bug.  I do not hold out much hope for that.",0

Before I could install this, I had to update my OS X.  I have been ignoring, or doing my best to ignore 10.7 Lion.  I can fly with 10.6 and sometimes these upgrades seem gratuitous, especially with all the problems this one reportedly caused.  But it was worse than that because Apple wouldn't let me go up one step.  The word I am thinking of starts with a B, has 8 letters, and rhymes with astards.  I had to go up to 10.8.

Then finally, I was able to start the Norton Internet Security. Something that should have taken five minutes took over an hour.  Why is it that I have so much difficulty doing simple things?  I had done the upgrade to 10.8, against my will, but nevertheless.  This should have been a breeze.  This is NORTON!

The first error was that I could not run a scan because the program I JUST installed could not load the scan engine because it needed to be updated.  REALLY?  I just updated it.  THREE minutes ago.  Neither could I slide the simple on button of virus protection.  I just got error readings that told me I needed to do a Live Update that wouldn't run because I JUST did it.

I LOLed very loudly when I saw the same things happened to him for awhile.  He finally just deleted everything Norton from my computer and reinstalled it.

"Item: Cyberlink PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Rating 4.5 stars.
I really enjoy this software for playing files. I've used older versions without problems. I've also used WinDVD versions as well, and like that program too. I use more of Cyberlink's other programs like Power2Go and Director.

Install process: The install is straightforward and only took 5 minutes. After install, enter the product key, then you need an internet connection for the product activation which took 3 seconds.  First, on the Welcome Screen, click on Media Library Preference. In the Movie Library, delete or add folders you want to connect with PowerDVD. It will sync those
folders with the software. Do that for Movies, the Videos/Photos tab, and Music tab.

Next screen is the Cyberlink Cloud Service. Redeem you free one year now or later. You can upload your content from your smartphone to the cloud to be accessed later on by your other devices.

After setup was complete, I ran the updates, and that was a fairly quick process. Interface: It's a very clean and organized interface. You can drag files into the player and it will begin playing them. It's a fast program and processes everything quickly. I'm running a AMD Quad-Core processor 64-bit, with 8GB RAM, and a 1GB ATI video card. You can also create playlists of various files. I noticed that the software had automatically associated certain files with the software. While I prefer using other programs. You can change the program back by right-clicking a file and selecting ""Choose default program"" and then select the program and make sure ""Always use this as default program"" is checked. There are instructions online to change programs associated with files. This should never have been done. I'm subtracting 1/2 a star for it. But since I'm experienced with this stuff it doesn't bother me much. Others may be annoyed.

In creating PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Cyberlink knew they had to bring a much morepromising experience to PC users.  This whole package was created to be a seamless and easy to share experience.  You can easily share to Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, or Vimeo. For those who like using Vimeo forvideo-sharing, Vimeo support has also been added in this version.  I own version 11 as well, and had no issues with that version. Version 14 proves to run without problems for me. They've added support for
the new HEVC/H.265 format with this version.

Using a blu-ray optical drive, this software plays DVDs, Blu-rays, 3D Blu-rays and4K Blu-rays.  The software can also view 3D photos and videos.  BD Live is alsosupported. I tried all the types of optical discs mentioned above, and they all
played without any problem. I had to use a different computer and TV to try out the 4k discs. 4K, 3D, and 60fps discs and files require much more processing power and I had to use a 2GB video card and a much better processor.  Everthing ran smoothly.
You can also play AVCHD, MP4, MKV, and M2TS files. A tried all different files mentioned above and they all played properly.

The Ultra version includes PowerDVD Remote v2, and Power Media Player (for Android/iOS and also Windows). PowerDVD Remote requires you to install an app on or iOS or Android device, and then you can use that as a remote control, or a
wireless mouse pad and keyboard for PowerDVD.  The app works well for me on my iPhone.

CLOUD: Included with the software is a free one-year subscription of 10GB to Cyberlink's Cloud service. Price after is $10 per every 10GB of storage. You can upload your files to their cloud service and access them anywhere. The cloud
service works fast on a fast connection, but remember it depends on how fast your connection is.

Normally, I use my big-screen LCD TV, PS3 blu-ray payer, and 7.1 speaker setup for my optical disc movie-watching needs. Since I can connect my PCs to my medium-size monitor or my big-screen TV, I'm available to view all my other files that aren't on optical discs.

INCLUDED: Also included are trial versions of other Cyberlink products: PhotoDirector 5, PowerDirector 12, DirectorSuite 2, Power2Go 9, YouCam 6, and MediaEspresso 6.7. Some of them I've used before and they are really good.",0
"For nearly 3 years my desktop computer has had all kinds of periods flubs and headaches. I always blamed the computer. Finally I got rid of Norton and installed this software and voila, my computers working much better all the time. I'm also getting Microsoft updates by the score that must not have been able to get through with Norton. Everybody says that Norton's a memory hog too. Very pleased.",0
"And H&R Block kept up with the rules and regulations thrown at us each year.

I was fortunate enough to be a Beta tester this year for the Quicken Home and Business 2012 product. I was very pleased with the performance improvements in Quicken. There are improvements in click point access that make using the program easier and more convenient in areas ranging from reconciling my checkbook to downloading transactions.,0
This once was the best software. Now? Not so much. I do not recommend buying this. The last 2 downloads I made with is software had issues. Webroot Tech is a joke. They sent links that had nothing to the issues I asked about. It's a waste of time. Buy something else. I will when this expires.,1
